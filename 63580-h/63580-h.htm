<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

THE FIRE OF LONDON.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;YOU&#8217;RE wanted on the telephone, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bruce Bowring, managing director
of the Consolidated Mining and Investment Corporation,
Limited (capital two millions, in one-pound
shares, which stood at twenty-seven-and-six),
turned and gazed querulously across the
electric-lit spaces of his superb private office at
the confidential clerk who addressed him. Mr.
Bowring, in shirt-sleeves before a Florentine mirror,
was brushing his hair with the solicitude of
a mother who has failed to rear most of a large
family.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; he asked, as if that demand for
him were the last straw but one. &#8220;Nearly seven
on Friday evening!&#8221; he added, martyrised.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think a friend, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The middle-aged financier dropped his gold-mounted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
brush and, wading through the deep
pile of the Oriental carpet, passed into the telephone-cabinet
and shut the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo!&#8221; he accosted the transmitter, resolved
not to be angry with it. &#8220;Hal<i>lo</i>! Are
you there? Yes, I&#8217;m Bowring. Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Nrrrr</i>,&#8221; the faint, unhuman voice of the
receiver whispered in his ear. &#8220;<i>Nrrrr. Cluck.</i>
I&#8217;m a friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No name. I thought you might like to
know that a determined robbery is going to be
attempted to-night at your house in Lowndes
Square, a robbery of cash&mdash;and before nine
o&#8217;clock. <i>Nrrrr.</i> I thought you might like to
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Mr. Bowring to the transmitter.</p>

<p>The feeble exclamation was all he could
achieve at first. In the confined, hot silence of
the telephone-cabinet this message, coming to him
mysteriously out of the vast unknown of London,
struck him with a sudden sick fear that perhaps
his wondrously organised scheme might yet mis-carry,
even at the final moment. Why that night
of all nights? And why before nine o&#8217;clock?
Could it be that the secret was out, then?</p>

<p>&#8220;Any further interesting details?&#8221; he inquired,
bracing himself to an assumption of imperturbable
and gay coolness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>But there was no answer. And when after
some difficulty he got the exchange-girl to disclose
the number which had rung him up, he
found that his interlocutor had been using a
public call-office in Oxford Street. He returned
to his room, donned his frock-coat, took a large
envelope from a locked drawer and put it in his
pocket, and sat down to think a little.</p>

<p>At that time Mr. Bruce Bowring was one of
the most famous conjurers in the City. He had
begun, ten years earlier, with nothing but a silk
hat; and out of that empty hat had been produced,
first the Hoop-La Limited, a South African
gold-mine of numerous stamps and frequent dividends,
then the Hoop-La No. 2 Limited, a mine
with as many reincarnations as Buddha, and then
a dazzling succession of mines and combination of
mines. The more the hat emptied itself, the more
it was full; and the emerging objects (which now
included the house in Lowndes Square and a perfect
dream of a place in Hampshire) grew constantly
larger, and the conjurer more impressive
and persuasive, and the audience more enthusiastic
in its applause. At last, with a unique
flourish, and a new turning-up of sleeves to prove
that there was no deception, had come out of the
hat the C.M.I.C., a sort of incredibly enormous
Union Jack, which enwrapped all the other objects
in its splendid folds. The shares of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
C.M.I.C. were affectionately known in the Kaffir
circus as &#8220;Solids&#8221;; they yielded handsome
though irregular dividends, earned chiefly by
flotation and speculation; the circus believed in
them. And in view of the annual meeting of
shareholders to be held on the following Tuesday
afternoon (the conjurer in the chair and his hat
on the table), the market price, after a period of
depression, had stiffened.</p>

<p>Mr. Bowring&#8217;s meditations were soon interrupted
by a telegram. He opened it and read:
&#8220;<i>Cook drunk again. Will dine with you Devonshire,
seven-thirty. Impossible here. Have arranged
about luggage.&mdash;Marie.</i>&#8221; Marie was Mr.
Bowring&#8217;s wife. He told himself that he felt
greatly relieved by that telegram; he clutched at
it; and his spirits seemed to rise. At any rate,
since he would not now go near Lowndes Square,
he could certainly laugh at the threatened robbery.
He thought what a wonderful thing Providence
was, after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just look at that,&#8221; he said to his clerk, showing
the telegram with a humorous affectation of
dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut,&#8221; said the clerk, discreetly sympathetic
towards his employer thus victimised by
debauched cooks. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re going down
to Hampshire to-night as usual, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bowring replied that he was, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
everything appeared to be in order for the
meeting, and that he should be back on Monday
afternoon or at the latest very early on
Tuesday.</p>

<p>Then, with a few parting instructions, and
with that eagle glance round his own room and
into circumjacent rooms which a truly efficient
head of affairs never omits on leaving business
for the week-end, Mr. Bowring sedately, yet
magnificently, departed from the noble registered
offices of the C.M.I.C.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t Marie telephone instead of wiring?&#8221;
he mused, as his pair of greys whirled him
and his coachman and his footman off to the
Devonshire.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>The Devonshire Mansion, a bright edifice of
eleven storeys in the Foster and Dicksee style, constructional
ironwork by Homan, lifts by Waygood,
decorations by Waring, and terra-cotta by
the rood, is situate on the edge of Hyde Park.
It is a composite building. Its foundations are
firmly fixed in the Tube railway; above that
comes the wine cellarage, then the vast laundry,
and then (a row of windows scarcely level with
the street) a sporting club, a billiard-room, a grill-room,
and a cigarette-merchant whose name ends
in &#8220;opoulos.&#8221; On the first floor is the renowned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
Devonshire Mansion Restaurant. Always, in London,
there is just one restaurant where, if you are
an entirely correct person, &#8220;you can get a decent
meal.&#8221; The place changes from season to season,
but there is never more than one of it at a time.
That season it happened to be the Devonshire.
(The <i>chef</i> of the Devonshire had invented tripe
suppers, <i>tripes &agrave; la mode de Caen</i>, and these suppers&mdash;seven-and-six&mdash;had
been the rage.) Consequently
all entirely correct people fed as a matter
of course at the Devonshire, since there was no
other place fit to go to. The vogue of the restaurant
favourably affected the vogue of the nine
floors of furnished suites above the restaurant;
they were always full; and the heavenward attics,
where the servants took off their smart liveries and
became human, held much wealth. The vogue of
the restaurant also exercised a beneficial influence
over the status of the Kitcat Club, which was a
cock-and-hen club of the latest pattern and had
its &#8220;house&#8221; on the third floor.</p>

<p>It was a little after half-past seven when Mr.
Bruce Bowring haughtily ascended the grand
staircase of this resort of opulence, and paused
for an instant near the immense fireplace at the
summit (September was inclement, and a fire
burned nicely) to inquire from the head-waiter
whether Mrs. Bowring had secured a table. But
Marie had not arrived&mdash;Marie, who was never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
late! Uneasy and chagrined, he proceeded, under
the escort of the head-waiter, to the glittering
Salle Louis Quatorze and selected, because of
his morning attire, a table half-hidden behind an
onyx pillar. The great room was moderately full
of fair women and possessive men, despite the
month. Immediately afterwards a youngish
couple (the man handsomer and better dressed
than the woman) took the table on the other side
of the pillar. Mr. Bowring waited five minutes,
then he ordered Sole Mornay and a bottle of
Roman&eacute;e-Conti, and then he waited another five
minutes. He went somewhat in fear of his wife,
and did not care to begin without her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you read?&#8221; It was the youngish
man at the next table speaking in a raised voice
to a squinting lackey with a telegraph form in his
hand. &#8220;&#8216;Solids! Solids,&#8217; my friend. &#8216;Sell&mdash;Solids&mdash;to&mdash;any&mdash;amount&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;and&mdash;Monday.&#8217;
Got it? Well, send it off at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite clear, my lord,&#8221; said the lackey, and
fled. The youngish man gazed fixedly but absently
at Mr. Bowring and seemed to see through
him to the tapestry behind. Mr. Bowring, to his
own keen annoyance, reddened. Partly to conceal
the blush, and partly because it was a quarter
to eight and there was the train to catch, he lowered
his face, and began upon the sole. A few
minutes later the lackey returned, gave some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
change to the youngish man, and surprised Mr.
Bowring by advancing towards him and handing
him an envelope&mdash;an envelope which bore on its
flap the legend &#8220;Kitcat Club.&#8221; The note within
was scribbled in pencil in his wife&#8217;s handwriting,
and ran: &#8220;<i>Just arrived. Delayed by luggage. I&#8217;m
too nervous to face the restaurant, and am eating a
chop here alone. The place is fortunately empty.
Come and fetch me as soon as you&#8217;re ready.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bowring sighed angrily. He hated his
wife&#8217;s club, and this succession of messages telephonic,
telegraphic, and caligraphic was exasperating
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No answer!&#8221; he ejaculated, and then he
beckoned the lackey closer. &#8220;Who&#8217;s that gentleman
at the next table with the lady?&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not rightly sure, sir,&#8221; was the whispered
reply. &#8220;Some authorities say he&#8217;s the strong
man at the Hippodrome, while others affirm he&#8217;s
a sort of American millionaire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you addressed him as &#8216;my lord.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just then I thought he was the strong man,
sir,&#8221; said the lackey, retiring.</p>

<p>&#8220;My bill!&#8221; Mr. Bowring demanded fiercely
of the waiter, and at the same time the youngish
gentleman and his companion rose and departed.</p>

<p>At the lift Mr. Bowring found the squinting
lackey in charge.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re the liftman, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night, sir, I am many things. The fact
is, the regular liftman has got a couple of hours
off&mdash;being the recent father of twins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;Kitcat Club.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lift seemed to shoot far upwards, and Mr.
Bowring thought the lackey had mistaken the
floor, but on gaining the corridor he saw across
the portals in front of him the remembered gold
sign, &#8220;Kitcat Club. Members only.&#8221; He pushed
the door open and went in.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>Instead of the familiar vestibule of his wife&#8217;s
club, Mr. Bowring discovered a small antechamber,
and beyond, through a doorway half-screened
by a <i>porti&egrave;re</i>, he had glimpses of a
rich, rose-lit drawing-room. In the doorway,
with one hand raised to the <i>porti&egrave;re</i>, stood the
youngish man who had forced him to blush in
the restaurant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said Mr. Bowring,
stiffly&mdash;&#8220;is this the Kitcat Club?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other man advanced to the outer door,
his brilliant eyes fixed on Mr. Bowring&#8217;s; his
arm crept round the cheek of the door and came
back bearing the gold sign; then he shut the door
and locked it. &#8220;No, this isn&#8217;t the Kitcat Club at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
all,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;It is my flat. Come and sit
down. I was expecting you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do nothing of the kind,&#8221; said Mr.
Bowring disdainfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;But when I tell you that I know you are
going to decamp to-night, Mr. Bowring&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The youngish man smiled affably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Decamp?&#8221; The spine of the financier
suddenly grew flaccid.</p>

<p>&#8220;I used the word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who the devil are you?&#8221; snapped the financier,
forcing his spine to rigidity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the &#8216;friend&#8217; on the telephone. I specially
wanted you at the Devonshire to-night, and
I thought that the fear of a robbery at Lowndes
Square might make your arrival here more certain.
I am he who devised the story of the inebriated
cook and favoured you with a telegram
signed &#8216;Marie.&#8217; I am the humorist who pretended
in a loud voice to send off telegraphic instructions
to sell &#8216;Solids,&#8217; in order to watch your
demeanour under the test. I am the expert who
forged your wife&#8217;s handwriting in a note from the
Kitcat. I am the patron of the cross-eyed menial
who gave you the note and who afterwards raised
you too high in the lift. I am the artificer of this
gold sign, an exact duplicate of the genuine one
two floors below, which induced you to visit
me. The sign alone cost me nine-and-six; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
servant&#8217;s livery came to two pounds fifteen.
But I never consider expense when, by dint
of a generous outlay, I can avoid violence. I
hate violence.&#8221; He gently waved the sign to
and fro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then my wife&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Mr. Bowring stammered
in a panic rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is probably at Lowndes Square, wondering
what on earth has happened to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bowring took breath, remembered that he
was a great man, and steadied himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be mad,&#8221; he remarked quietly.
&#8220;Open this door at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; the stranger judicially admitted.
&#8220;Perhaps a sort of madness. But do come and
sit down. We have no time to lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bowring gazed at that handsome face,
with the fine nostrils, large mouth, and square
clean chin, and the dark eyes, the black hair, and
long, black moustache; and he noticed the long,
thin hands. &#8220;Decadent!&#8221; he decided. Nevertheless,
and though it was with the air of indulging
the caprice of a lunatic, he did in fact obey the
stranger&#8217;s request.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful Chippendale drawing-room
that he entered. Near the hearth, to which a
morsel of fire gave cheerfulness, were two easy-chairs,
and between them a small table. Behind
was extended a fourfold draught-screen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>&#8220;I can give you just five minutes,&#8221; said Mr.
Bowring, magisterially sitting down.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will suffice,&#8221; the stranger responded,
sitting down also. &#8220;You have in your pocket,
Mr. Bowring&mdash;probably your breast-pocket&mdash;fifty
Bank of England notes for a thousand pounds
each, and a number of smaller notes amounting
to another ten thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must demand from you the first-named
fifty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bowring, in the silence of the rose-lit
drawing-room, thought of all the Devonshire
Mansion, with its endless corridors and innumerable
rooms, its acres of carpets, its forests of furniture,
its gold and silver, and its jewels and its
wines, its pretty women and possessive men&mdash;the
whole humming microcosm founded on a unanimous
pretence that the sacredness of property
was a natural law. And he thought how disconcerting
it was that he should be trapped there,
helpless, in the very middle of the vast pretence,
and forced to admit that the sacredness of property
was a purely artificial convention.</p>

<p>&#8220;By what right do you make this demand?&#8221;
he inquired, bravely sarcastic.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the right of my unique knowledge,&#8221; said
the stranger, with a bright smile. &#8220;Listen to
what you and I alone know. You are at the end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
of the tether. The Consolidated is at the same
spot. You have a past consisting chiefly of nineteen
fraudulent flotations. You have paid dividends
out of capital till there is no capital left.
You have speculated and lost. You have cooked
balance-sheets to a turn and ruined the eyesight
of auditors with dust. You have lived like ten
lords. Your houses are mortgaged. You own
an unrivalled collection of unreceipted bills. You
are worse than a common thief. (Excuse these
personalities.)&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, good sir&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Mr. Bowring interrupted,
grandly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me. What is more serious, your self-confidence
has been gradually deserting you. At
last, perceiving that some blundering person was
bound soon to put his foot through the brittle shell
of your ostentation and tread on nothing, and foreseeing
for yourself an immediate future consisting
chiefly of Holloway, you have by a supreme
effort of your genius, borrowed &pound;60,000 from a
bank on C.M.I.C. scrip, for a week (eh?), and you
have arranged, you and your wife, to&mdash;melt into
thin air. You will affect to set out as usual for
your country place in Hampshire, but it is Southampton
that will see you to-night, and Havre
will see you to-morrow. You may run over to
Paris to change some notes, but by Monday you
will be on your way to&mdash;&mdash;frankly, I don&#8217;t know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
where; perhaps Monte Video. Of course you
take the risk of extradition, but the risk is preferable
to the certainty that awaits you in England.
I think you will elude extradition. If I
thought otherwise, I should not have had you
here to-night, because, once extradited, you might
begin to amuse yourself by talking about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s blackmail,&#8221; said Mr. Bowring, grim.</p>

<p>The dark eyes opposite to him sparkled gaily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It desolates me,&#8221; the youngish man observed,
&#8220;to have to commit you to the deep with only ten
thousand. But, really, not less than fifty thousand
will requite me for the brain-tissue which I have
expended in the study of your interesting situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bowring consulted his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, now,&#8221; he said, huskily; &#8220;I&#8217;ll give
you ten thousand. I flatter myself I can look
facts in the face, and so I&#8217;ll give you ten thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; answered the spider, &#8220;you are
a judge of character. Do you honestly think I
don&#8217;t mean precisely what I say&mdash;to sixpence?
It is eight-thirty. You are, if I may be allowed
the remark, running it rather fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And suppose I refuse to part?&#8221; said Mr.
Bowring, after reflection. &#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have confessed to you that I hate violence.
You would therefore leave this room unmolested,
but you wouldn&#8217;t step off the island.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>Mr. Bowring scanned the agreeable features
of the stranger. Then, while the lifts were ascending
and descending, and the wine was sparkling,
and the jewels flashing, and the gold chinking,
and the pretty women being pretty, in all the
four quarters of the Devonshire, Mr. Bruce Bowring
in the silent parlour counted out fifty notes
on to the table. After all, it was a fortune, that
little pile of white on the crimson polished wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Bon voyage!</i>&#8221; said the stranger. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
imagine that I am not full of sympathy for you.
I am. You have only been unfortunate. <i>Bon
voyage!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! By Heaven!&#8221; Mr. Bowring almost
shouted, rushing back from the door, and drawing
a revolver from his hip pocket. &#8220;It&#8217;s too
much! I didn&#8217;t mean to&mdash;but confound it!
what&#8217;s a revolver for?&#8221;</p>

<p>The youngish man jumped up quickly and put
his hands on the notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Violence is always foolish, Mr. Bowring,&#8221;
he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you give them up, or won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger&#8217;s fine eyes seemed to glint with
joy in the drama.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The revolver was raised, but in the same
instant a tiny hand snatched it from the hand of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Mr. Bowring, who turned and beheld by his side
a woman. The huge screen sank slowly and
noiselessly to the floor in the surprising manner
peculiar to screens that have been overset.</p>

<p>Mr. Bowring cursed. &#8220;An accomplice! I
might have guessed!&#8221; he grumbled in final disgust.</p>

<p>He ran to the door, unlocked it, and was no
more seen.</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>The lady was aged twenty-seven or so; of
medium height, and slim, with a plain, very intelligent
and expressive face, lighted by courageous,
grey eyes and crowned with loose, abundant,
fluffy hair. Perhaps it was the fluffy hair,
perhaps it was the mouth that twitched as she
dropped the revolver&mdash;who can say?&mdash;but the
whole atmosphere of the rose-lit chamber was
suddenly changed. The incalculable had invaded
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem surprised, Miss Fincastle,&#8221; said
the possessor of the bank-notes, laughing gaily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surprised!&#8221; echoed the lady, controlling
that mouth. &#8220;My dear Mr. Thorold, when,
strictly as a journalist, I accepted your invitation,
I did not anticipate this sequel; frankly I did
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to speak coldly and evenly, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
assumption that a journalist has no sex during
business hours. But just then she happened to
be neither less nor more a woman than a woman
always is.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I have had the misfortune to annoy
you&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221; Thorold threw up his arms in
gallant despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Annoy is not the word,&#8221; said Miss Fincastle,
nervously smiling. &#8220;May I sit down? Thanks.
Let us recount. You arrive in England, from
somewhere, as the son and heir of the late Ahasuerus
Thorold, the New York operator, who
died worth six million dollars. It becomes known
that while in Algiers in the spring you stayed at
the H&ocirc;tel St. James, famous as the scene of what
is called the &#8216;Algiers Mystery,&#8217; familiar to
English newspaper-readers since last April. The
editor of my journal therefore instructs me to
obtain an interview with you. I do so. The
first thing I discover is that, though an American,
you have no American accent. You explain this
by saying that since infancy you have always lived
in Europe with your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely you do not doubt that I am Cecil
Thorold!&#8221; said the man. Their faces were
approximate over the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. I merely recount. To
continue. I interview you as to the Algerian
mystery, and get some new items concerning it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Then you regale me with tea and your opinions,
and my questions grow more personal. So it
comes about that, strictly on behalf of my paper,
I inquire what your recreations are. And suddenly
you answer: &#8216;Ah! My recreations!
Come to dinner to-night, quite informally, and I
will show you how I amuse myself!&#8217; I come.
I dine. I am stuck behind that screen and told
to listen. And&mdash;and&mdash;the millionaire proves to
be nothing but a blackmailer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must understand, my dear lady&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand everything, Mr. Thorold, except
your object in admitting me to the scene.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A whim!&#8221; cried Thorold vivaciously, &#8220;a
freak of mine! Possibly due to the eternal and
universal desire of man to show off before
woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>The journalist tried to smile, but something
in her face caused Thorold to run to a chiffonier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drink this,&#8221; he said, returning with a glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need nothing.&#8221; The voice was a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oblige me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Fincastle drank and coughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you do it?&#8221; she asked sadly, looking
at the notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say,&#8221; Thorold burst out,
&#8220;that you are feeling sorry for Mr. Bruce Bowring?
He has merely parted with what he stole.
And the people from whom he stole, stole. All<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
the activities which centre about the Stock Exchange
are simply various manifestations of one
primeval instinct. Suppose I had not&mdash;had not
interfered. No one would have been a penny the
better off except Mr. Bruce Bowring. Whereas&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You intend to restore this money to the
Consolidated?&#8221; said Miss Fincastle eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite! The Consolidated doesn&#8217;t deserve
it. You must not regard its shareholders
as a set of innocent shorn lambs. They knew
the game. They went in for what they could
get. Besides, how could I restore the money
without giving myself away? I want the money
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are a millionaire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is precisely because I am a millionaire that
I want more. All millionaires are like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to find you a thief, Mr. Thorold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thief! No. I am only direct, I only
avoid the middleman. At dinner, Miss Fincastle,
you displayed somewhat advanced views about
property, marriage, and the aristocracy of brains.
You said that labels were for the stupid majority,
and that the wise minority examined the ideas
behind the labels. You label me a thief, but
examine the idea, and you will perceive that you
might as well call yourself a thief. Your newspaper
every day suppresses the truth about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
City, and it does so in order to live. In other
words, it touches the pitch, it participates in the
game. To-day it has a fifty-line advertisement
of a false balance-sheet of the Consolidated, at two
shillings a line. That five pounds, part of the
loot of a great city, will help to pay for your
account of our interview this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our interview to-night,&#8221; Miss Fincastle
corrected him stiffly, &#8220;and all that I have seen
and heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words she stood up, and as Cecil
Thorold gazed at her his face changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall begin to wish,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;that
I had deprived myself of the pleasure of your
company this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have been a dead man had you
done so,&#8221; Miss Fincastle retorted, and observing
his blank countenance she touched the revolver.
&#8220;Have you forgotten already?&#8221; she asked tartly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it wasn&#8217;t loaded,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;Of course I had seen to that earlier in the day.
I am not such a bungler&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I didn&#8217;t save your life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You force me to say that you did not, and to
remind you that you gave me your word not to
emerge from behind the screen. However, seeing
the motive, I can only thank you for that lapse.
The pity is that it hopelessly compromises you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; exclaimed Miss Fincastle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>&#8220;You. Can&#8217;t you see that you are in it, in
this robbery, to give the thing a label. You were
alone with the robber. You succoured the robber
at a critical moment.... &#8216;Accomplice,&#8217; Mr.
Bowring himself said. My dear journalist, the
episode of the revolver, empty though the revolver
was, seals your lips.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Fincastle laughed rather hysterically, leaning
over the table with her hands on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear millionaire,&#8221; she said rapidly, &#8220;you
don&#8217;t know the new journalism to which I have
the honour to belong. You would know it better
had you lived more in New York. All I have to
announce is that, compromised or not, a full
account of this affair will appear in my paper to-morrow
morning. No, I shall not inform the
police. I am a journalist simply, but a journalist
I <i>am</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your promise, which you gave me before
going behind the screen, your solemn promise
that you would reveal nothing? I was loth to
mention it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some promises, Mr. Thorold, it is a duty to
break, and it is my duty to break this one. I
should never have given it had I had the slightest
idea of the nature of your recreations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thorold still smiled, though faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, you know,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;this is
getting just a little serious.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>&#8220;It is very serious,&#8221; she stammered.</p>

<p>And then Thorold noticed that the new journalist
was softly weeping.</p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Kitty Sartorius,&#8221; said the erstwhile
liftman, who was now in plain clothes and had
mysteriously ceased to squint.</p>

<p>A beautiful girl, a girl who had remarkable
loveliness and was aware of it (one of the prettiest
women of the Devonshire), ran impulsively into
the room and caught Miss Fincastle by the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dearest Eve, you&#8217;re crying. What&#8217;s
the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lecky,&#8221; said Thorold aside to the servant.
&#8220;I told you to admit no one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The beautiful blonde turned sharply to
Thorold.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him I wished to enter,&#8221; she said imperiously,
half closing her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Lecky. &#8220;That was it. The
lady wished to enter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thorold bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was sufficient,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That will do,
Lecky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I say, Lecky, when next you address<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
me publicly, try to remember that I am not in the
peerage.&#8221;</p>

<p>The servant squinted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, sir.&#8221; And he retired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we are alone,&#8221; said Miss Sartorius.
&#8220;Introduce us, Eve, and explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Fincastle, having regained self-control,
introduced her dear friend the radiant star of the
Regency Theatre, and her acquaintance the millionaire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eve didn&#8217;t feel <i>quite</i> sure of you,&#8221; the actress
stated; &#8220;and so we arranged that if she wasn&#8217;t
up at my flat by nine o&#8217;clock, I was to come down
and reconnoitre. What have you been doing to
make Eve cry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unintentional, I assure you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Thorold
began.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something between you two,&#8221; said
Kitty Sartorius sagaciously, in significant accents.
&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat down, touched her picture hat,
smoothed her white gown, and tapped her foot.
&#8220;What is it, now? Mr. Thorold, I think <i>you</i>
had better tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thorold raised his eyebrows and obediently
commenced the narration, standing with his back
to the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;How perfectly splendid!&#8221; Kitty exclaimed.
&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you cornered Mr. Bowring. I met<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
him one night and I thought he was horrid. And
these are the notes? Well, of all the&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thorold proceeded with his story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you can&#8217;t do <i>that</i>, Eve!&#8221; said Kitty,
suddenly serious. &#8220;You can&#8217;t go and split! It
would mean all sorts of bother; your wretched
newspaper would be sure to keep you hanging
about in London, and we shouldn&#8217;t be able to start
on our holiday to-morrow. Eve and I are starting
on quite a long tour to-morrow, Mr. Thorold;
we begin with Ostend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; said Thorold. &#8220;I, too, am going
in that direction soon. Perhaps we may meet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; Kitty smiled, and then she
looked at Eve Fincastle. &#8220;You really mustn&#8217;t
do <i>that</i>, Eve,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must, I must!&#8221; Miss Fincastle insisted,
clenching her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;And she will,&#8221; said Kitty tragically, after
considering her friend&#8217;s face. &#8220;She will, and
our holiday&#8217;s ruined. I see it&mdash;I see it plainly.
She&#8217;s in one of her stupid conscientious moods.
She&#8217;s fearfully advanced and careless and unconventional
in theory, Eve is; but when it
comes to practice&mdash;&mdash;! Mr. Thorold, you have
just got everything into a dreadful knot. Why
did you want those notes so very particularly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want them so very particularly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyhow, it&#8217;s a most peculiar predicament.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
Mr. Bowring doesn&#8217;t count, and this
Consolidated thingummy isn&#8217;t any the worse off.
Nobody suffers who oughtn&#8217;t to suffer. It&#8217;s your
unlawful gain that&#8217;s wrong. Why not pitch the
wretched notes in the fire?&#8221; Kitty laughed at
her own playful humour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Thorold. And with a quick
movement he put the fifty trifles in the grate,
where they made a bluish yellow flame.</p>

<p>Both the women screamed and sprang up.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mr.</i> Thorold!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. <i>Thorold</i>!&#8221; (&#8220;He&#8217;s adorable!&#8221; Kitty
breathed.)</p>

<p>&#8220;The incident, I venture to hope, is now
closed,&#8221; said Thorold calmly, but with his dark
eyes sparkling. &#8220;I must thank you both for a
very enjoyable evening. Some day, perhaps, I
may have an opportunity of further explaining
my philosophy to you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

A COMEDY ON THE GOLD COAST.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was five o&#8217;clock on an afternoon in mid-September,
and a couple of American millionaires
(they abounded that year, did millionaires) sat
chatting together on the wide terrace which
separates the entrance to the Kursaal from the
promenade. Some yards away, against the balustrade
of the terrace, in the natural, unconsidered
attitude of one to whom short frocks are a matter
of history, certainly, but very recent history, stood
a charming and imperious girl; you could see
that she was eating chocolate while meditating
upon the riddle of life. The elder millionaire
glanced at every pretty woman within view, excepting
only the girl; but his companion seemed
to be intent on counting the chocolates.</p>

<p>The immense crystal dome of the Kursaal
dominated the gold coast, and on either side of
the great building were stretched out in a straight
line the hotels, the restaurants, the <i>caf&eacute;s</i>, the
shops, the theatres, the concert-halls, and the
pawnbrokers of the City of Pleasure&mdash;Ostend. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
one extremity of that long array of ornate white
architecture (which resembled the icing on a bride-cake
more than the roofs of men) was the palace
of a king; at the other were the lighthouse and
the railway signals which guided into the city
the continuously arriving cargoes of wealth,
beauty, and desire. In front, the ocean, grey
and lethargic, idly beat up a little genteel foam
under the promenade for the wetting of pink feet
and stylish bathing-costumes. And after a hard
day&#8217;s work, the sun, by arrangement with the
authorities during August and September, was
setting over the sea exactly opposite the superb
portals of the Kursaal.</p>

<p>The younger of the millionaires was Cecil
Thorold. The other, a man fifty-five or so,
was Simeon Rainshore, father of the girl at the
balustrade, and president of the famous Dry
Goods Trust, of exciting memory. The contrast
between the two men, alike only in extreme riches,
was remarkable: Cecil still youthful, slim, dark,
languid of movement, with delicate features, eyes
almost Spanish, and an accent of purest English;
and Rainshore with his nasal twang, his stout
frame, his rounded, bluish-red chin, his little eyes,
and that demeanour of false briskness by means
of which ageing men seek to prove to themselves
that they are as young as ever they were. Simeon
had been a friend and opponent of Cecil&#8217;s father;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
in former days those twain had victimised each
other for colossal sums. Consequently Simeon
had been glad to meet the son of his dead antagonist,
and, in less than a week of Ostend repose,
despite a fundamental disparity of temperament,
the formidable president and the Europeanised
wanderer had achieved a sort of intimacy, an
intimacy which was about to be intensified.</p>

<p>&#8220;The difference between you and me is this,&#8221;
Cecil was saying. &#8220;You exhaust yourself by
making money among men who are all bent on
making money, in a place specially set apart for
the purpose. I amuse myself by making money
among men who, having made or inherited money,
are bent on spending it, in places specially set
apart for the purpose. I take people off their
guard. They don&#8217;t precisely see me coming. I
don&#8217;t rent an office and put up a sign which is
equivalent to announcing that the rest of the
world had better look out for itself. Our codes
are the same, but is not my way more original
and more diverting? Look at this place. Half
the wealth of Europe is collected here; the other
half is at Trouville. The entire coast reeks of
money; the sands are golden with it. You&#8217;ve
only to put out your hand&mdash;so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So?&#8221; ejaculated Rainshore, quizzical.
&#8220;How? Show me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! That would be telling.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>&#8220;I guess you wouldn&#8217;t get much out of Simeon&mdash;not
as much as your father did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you imagine I should try?&#8221; said Cecil
gravely. &#8220;My amusements are always discreet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you confess you are often bored. Now,
on Wall Street we are never bored.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Cecil admitted. &#8220;I embarked on
these&mdash;these enterprises mainly to escape boredom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to marry,&#8221; said Rainshore pointedly.
&#8220;You ought to marry, my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my yacht.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt. And she&#8217;s a beauty, and feminine
too; but not feminine enough. You ought
to marry. Now, I&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Rainshore paused. His daughter had suddenly
ceased to eat chocolates and was leaning over
the balustrade in order to converse with a tall,
young man whose fair, tanned face and white hat
overtopped the carved masonry and were thus
visible to the millionaires. The latter glanced at
one another and then glanced away, each slightly
self-conscious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought Mr. Vaux-Lowry had left?&#8221; said
Cecil.</p>

<p>&#8220;He came back last night,&#8221; Rainshore replied
curtly. &#8220;And he leaves again to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;then it&#8217;s a match after all!&#8221; Cecil
ventured.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>&#8220;Who says that?&#8221; was Simeon&#8217;s sharp inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;The birds of the air whisper it. One heard
it at every corner three days ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rainshore turned his chair a little towards
Cecil&#8217;s. &#8220;You&#8217;ll allow I ought to know something
about it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, I tell you it&#8217;s a
lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I mentioned it,&#8221; Cecil apologised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Simeon, stroking his chin.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you did. Because now you can just tell
all the birds of the air direct from me that in this
particular case there isn&#8217;t going to be the usual
alliance between the beauty and dollars of America
and the aristocratic blood of Great Britain. Listen
right here,&#8221; he continued confidentially, like a man
whose secret feelings have been inconveniencing
him for several hours. &#8220;This young spark&mdash;mind,
I&#8217;ve nothing against him!&mdash;asks me to
consent to his engagement with Geraldine. I
tell him that I intend to settle half a million
dollars on my daughter, and that the man she
marries must cover that half-million with another.
He says he has a thousand a year of his
own, pounds&mdash;just nice for Geraldine&#8217;s gloves
and candy!&mdash;and that he is the heir of his uncle,
Lord Lowry; and that there is an entail; and
that Lord Lowry is very rich, very old, and very
unmarried; but that, being also very peculiar, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
won&#8217;t come down with any money. It occurs to
me to remark: &#8216;Suppose Lord Lowry marries
and develops into the father of a man-child, where
do <i>you</i> come in, Mr. Vaux-Lowry?&#8217; &#8216;Oho!
Lord Lowry marry! Impossible! Laughable!&#8217;
Then Geraldine begins to worry at me, and her
mother too. And so I kind of issue an ultimatum&mdash;namely,
I will consent to an engagement without
a settlement if, on the marriage, Lord Lowry
will give a note of hand for half a million dollars
to Geraldine, payable on <i>his</i> marriage. See? My
lord&#8217;s nephew goes off to persuade my lord, and
returns with my lord&#8217;s answer in an envelope
sealed with the great seal. I open it and I read&mdash;this
is what I read: &#8216;To Mr. S. Rainshore,
American draper. Sir&mdash;As a humorist you rank
high. Accept the admiration of Your obedient
servant, Lowry.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The millionaire laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! It&#8217;s clever enough!&#8221; said Rainshore.
&#8220;It&#8217;s very English and grand. Dashed if I don&#8217;t
admire it! All the same, I&#8217;ve requested Mr.
Vaux-Lowry, under the circumstances, to quit
this town. I didn&#8217;t show him the letter&mdash;no. I
spared his delicate feelings. I merely told him
Lord Lowry had refused, and that I would be
ready to consider his application favourably any
time when he happened to have half a million
dollars in his pocket.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>&#8220;And Miss Geraldine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s flying the red flag, but she knows
when my back&#8217;s against the wall. She knows
her father. She&#8217;ll recover. Great Scott! She&#8217;s
eighteen, he&#8217;s twenty-one; the whole affair is a
high farce. And, moreover, I guess I want Geraldine
to marry an American, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if she elopes?&#8221; Cecil murmured as if
to himself, gazing at the set features of the girl,
who was now alone once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Elopes?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Rainshore&#8217;s face reddened as his mood shifted
suddenly from indulgent cynicism to profound
anger. Cecil was amazed at the transformation,
until he remembered to have heard long ago that
Simeon himself had eloped.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was just a fancy that flashed into my
mind,&#8221; Cecil smiled diplomatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should let it flash out again if I were you,&#8221;
said Rainshore, with a certain grimness. And
Cecil perceived the truth of the maxim that a
parent can never forgive his own fault in his
child.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve come to sympathise with me,&#8221; said
Geraldine Rainshore calmly, as Cecil, leaving the
father for a few moments, strolled across the
terrace towards the daughter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s my honest, kindly face that gives me
away,&#8221; he responded lightly. &#8220;But what am I
to sympathise with you about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what,&#8221; the girl said briefly.</p>

<p>They stood together near the balustrade, looking
out over the sea into the crimson eye of the
sun; and all the afternoon activities of Ostend
were surging round them&mdash;the muffled sound of
musical instruments from within the Kursaal, the
shrill cries of late bathers from the shore, the toot
of a tramway-horn to the left, the roar of a siren
to the right, and everywhere the ceaseless hum
of an existence at once gay, feverish, and futile;
but Cecil was conscious of nothing but the individuality
by his side. Some women, he reflected,
are older at eighteen than they are at thirty-eight,
and Geraldine was one of those. She happened
to be very young and very old at the same time.
She might be immature, crude, even gawky in her
girlishness; but she was just then in the first
flush of mentally realising the absolute independence
of the human spirit. She had force, and she
had also the enterprise to act on it.</p>

<p>As Cecil glanced at her intelligent, expressive
face, he thought of her playing with life as a
child plays with a razor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that father has been talking about
me to you. I could tell by his eyes. Well?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>&#8220;Your directness unnerves me,&#8221; he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull yourself together, then, Mr. Thorold.
Be a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you let me treat you as a friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll promise not
to tell me I&#8217;m only eighteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am incapable of such rudeness,&#8221; Cecil replied.
&#8220;A woman is as old as she feels. You
feel at least thirty; therefore you are at least
thirty. This being understood, I am going to
suggest, as a friend, that if you and Mr. Vaux-Lowry
are&mdash;perhaps pardonably&mdash;contemplating
any extreme step&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Extreme step, Mr. Thorold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything rash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And suppose we are?&#8221; Geraldine demanded,
raising her chin scornfully and defiantly
and dangling her parasol.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should respectfully and confidentially advise
you to refrain. Be content to wait, my dear
middle-aged woman. Your father may relent.
And also, I have a notion that I may be able to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Help us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are real good,&#8221; said Geraldine coldly.
&#8220;But what gave you the idea that Harry and I
were meaning to&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something in your eyes&mdash;your fine, daring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
eyes. I read you as you read your father, you
see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, Mr. Thorold, there&#8217;s something
wrong with my fine, daring eyes. I&#8217;m just the last
girl in all America to do anything&mdash;rash. Why!
if I did anything rash, I&#8217;m sure I should feel ever
afterwards as if I wanted to be excused off the
very face of the earth. I&#8217;m that sort of girl.
Do you think I don&#8217;t know that father will give
way? I guess he&#8217;s just got to. With time and
hammering, you can knock sense into the head of
any parent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I apologise,&#8221; said Cecil, both startled and
convinced. &#8220;And I congratulate Mr. Vaux-Lowry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say. You like Harry, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much. He&#8217;s the ideal type of Englishman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geraldine nodded sweetly. &#8220;And so obedient!
He does everything I tell him. He is leaving
for England to-night, not because father
asked him to, but because I did. I&#8217;m going to
take mother to Brussels for a few days&#8217; shopping&mdash;lace,
you know. That will give father an opportunity
to meditate in solitude on his own
greatness. Tell me, Mr. Thorold, do you consider
that Harry and I would be justified in corresponding
secretly?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil assumed a pose of judicial gravity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>&#8220;I think you would,&#8221; he decided. &#8220;But
don&#8217;t tell anyone I said so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even Harry?&#8221;</p>

<p>She ran off into the Kursaal, saying she must
seek her mother. But instead of seeking her
mother, Geraldine passed straight through the
concert-hall, where a thousand and one wondrously
attired women were doing fancy needle-work
to the accompaniment of a band of music,
into the maze of corridors beyond, and so to the
rear entrance of the Kursaal on the Boulevard van
Isoghem. Here she met Mr. Harry Vaux-Lowry,
who was most obviously waiting for her. They
crossed the road to the empty tramway waiting-room
and entered it and sat down; and by the
mere act of looking into each other&#8217;s eyes, these
two&mdash;the stiff, simple, honest-faced young Englishman
with &#8220;Oxford&#8221; written all over him, and
the charming child of a civilisation equally proud,
but with fewer conventions, suddenly transformed
the little bureau into a Cupid&#8217;s bower.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as I thought, you darling boy,&#8221;
Geraldine began to talk rapidly. &#8220;Father&#8217;s the
least bit in the world scared; and when he&#8217;s
scared, he&#8217;s bound to confide in someone; and
he&#8217;s confided in that sweet Mr. Thorold. And
Mr. Thorold has been requested to reason with
me and advise me to be a good girl and wait.
I know what <i>that</i> means. It means that father<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
thinks we shall soon forget each other, my poor
Harry. And I do believe it means that father
wants me to marry Mr. Thorold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say to him, dear?&#8221; the lover
demanded, pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust me to fool him, Harry. I simply
walked round him. He thinks we are going to
be very good and wait patiently. As if father ever
<i>would</i> give way until he was forced!&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed disdainfully. &#8220;So we&#8217;re perfectly
safe so long as we act with discretion. Now let&#8217;s
clearly understand. To-day&#8217;s Monday. You return
to England to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And I&#8217;ll arrange about the licence and
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your cousin Mary is just as important as the
licence, Harry,&#8221; said Geraldine primly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She will come. You may rely on her being
at Ostend with me on Thursday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. In the meantime, I behave as if
life were a blank. Brussels will put them off the
scent. Mother and I will return from there on
Thursday afternoon. That night there is a <i>soir&eacute;e
dansante</i> at the Kursaal. Mother will say she is
too tired to go to it, but she will have to go all
the same. I will dance before all men till a
quarter to ten&mdash;I will even dance with Mr. Thorold.
What a pity I can&#8217;t dance before father,
but he&#8217;s certain to be in the gambling-rooms then,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
winning money; he always is at that hour! At
a quarter to ten I will slip out, and you&#8217;ll be here
at this back door with a carriage. We drive to
the quay and just catch the 11.5 steamer, and I
meet your cousin Mary. On Friday morning we
are married; and then, then we shall be in a
position to talk to father. He&#8217;ll pretend to be
furious, but he can&#8217;t say much, because he eloped
himself. Didn&#8217;t you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Harry, with a certain dryness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! It&#8217;s in the family! But you
needn&#8217;t look so starched, my English lord.&#8221; He
took her hand. &#8220;You&#8217;re sure your uncle won&#8217;t
disinherit you, or anything horrid of that kind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Harry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a perfectly lovely country England
is!&#8221; Geraldine exclaimed. &#8220;Fancy the poor
old thing not being <i>able</i> to disinherit you! Why,
it&#8217;s just too delicious for words!&#8221;</p>

<p>And for some reason or other he kissed her
violently.</p>

<p>Then an official entered the bureau and asked
them if they wanted to go to Blankenburghe;
because, if so, the tram was awaiting their distinguished
pleasure. They looked at each other
foolishly and sidled out, and the bureau ceased
to be Cupid&#8217;s bower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>By Simeon&#8217;s request, Cecil dined with the
Rainshores that night at the Continental. After
dinner they all sat out on the balcony and sustained
themselves with coffee while watching the
gay traffic of the Digue, the brilliant illumination
of the Kursaal, and the distant lights on the invisible
but murmuring sea. Geraldine was in one
of her moods of philosophic pessimism, and would
persist in dwelling on the uncertainty of riches
and the vicissitudes of millionaires. She found
a text in the famous Bowring case, of which the
newspaper contained many interesting details.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if he&#8217;ll be caught?&#8221; she remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Cecil.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think, father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you had better go to bed,&#8221; Simeon
replied.</p>

<p>The chit rose and kissed him duteously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you glad
the sea keeps so calm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you ask? Mr. Vaux-Lowry crosses to-night,
and he&#8217;s a dreadfully bad sailor. Come
along, mother. Mr. Thorold, when mother and
I return from Brussels, we shall expect to be
taken for a cruise in the <i>Claribel</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simeon sighed with relief upon the departure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
of his family and began a fresh cigar. On the
whole, his day had been rather too domestic. He
was quite pleased when Cecil, having apparently
by accident broached the subject of the Dry
Goods Trust, proceeded to exhibit a minute curiosity
concerning the past, the present, and the
future of the greatest of all the Rainshore enterprises.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you thinking of coming in?&#8221; Simeon
demanded at length, pricking up his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Cecil, &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of going out.
The fact is, I haven&#8217;t mentioned it before, but
I&#8217;m ready to sell a very large block of shares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The deuce you are!&#8221; Simeon exclaimed.
&#8220;And what do you call a very large block?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Cecil, &#8220;it would cost me nearly
half a million to take them up now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dollars?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pounds sterling. Twenty-five thousand
shares, at 95&#8540;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rainshore whistled two bars of &#8220;Follow me!&#8221;
from &#8220;The Belle of New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this how you amuse yourself at Ostend?&#8221;
he inquired.</p>

<p>Cecil smiled: &#8220;This is quite an exceptional
transaction. And not too profitable, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t dump that lot on the market,&#8221;
Simeon protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I can,&#8221; said Cecil. &#8220;I must, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
will. There are reasons. You yourself wouldn&#8217;t
care to handle it, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>The president of the Trust pondered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d handle it at 93&#8540;,&#8221; he answered quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come! That&#8217;s dropping two points!&#8221;
said Cecil, shocked. &#8220;A minute ago you were
prophesying a further rise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rainshore&#8217;s face gleamed out momentarily in
the darkness as he puffed at his cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you must unload,&#8221; he remarked, as if addressing
the red end of the cigar, &#8220;I&#8217;m your man
at 93&#8540;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil argued: but Simeon Rainshore never
argued&mdash;it was not his method. In a quarter of
an hour the younger man had contracted to sell
twenty-five thousand shares of a hundred dollars
each in the United States Dry Goods Trust at
two points below the current market quotation,
and six and five-eighths points below par.</p>

<p>The hoot of an outgoing steamer sounded
across the city.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go,&#8221; said Cecil.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in a mighty hurry,&#8221; Simeon complained.</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>Five minutes later Cecil was in his own rooms
at the H&ocirc;tel de la Plage. Soon there was a discreet
knock at the door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>&#8220;Come in, Lecky,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>It was his servant who entered, the small, thin
man with very mobile eyes and of no particular
age, who, in various capacities and incarnations&mdash;now
as liftman, now as financial agent, now as no
matter what&mdash;assisted Cecil in his diversions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Vaux-Lowry really did go by the boat,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. And you have given directions about
the yacht?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The affair is in order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve procured one of Mr. Rainshore&#8217;s
Homburg hats?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is in your dressing-room. There was no
mark of identification on it. So, in order to
smooth the difficulties of the police when they
find it on the beach, I have taken the liberty of
writing Mr. Rainshore&#8217;s name on the lining.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A kindly thought,&#8221; said Cecil. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
catch the special G.S.N. steamer direct for London
at 1 a.m. That will get you into town before
two o&#8217;clock to-morrow afternoon. Things have
turned out as I expected, and I&#8217;ve nothing else
to say to you; but, before leaving me, perhaps
you had better repeat your instructions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure, sir,&#8221; said Lecky. &#8220;Tuesday
afternoon.&mdash;I call at Cloak Lane and intimate that
we want to sell Dry Goods shares. I ineffectually
try to conceal a secret cause for alarm, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
gradually disclose the fact that we are very anxious
indeed to sell really a lot of Dry Goods shares, in
a hurry. I permit myself to be pumped, and the
information is wormed out of me that Mr. Simeon
Rainshore has disappeared, has possibly committed
suicide; but that, at present, no one is
aware of this except ourselves. I express doubts
as to the soundness of the Trust, and I remark on
the unfortunateness of this disappearance so soon
after the lamentable panic connected with the
lately vanished Bruce Bowring and his companies.
I send our friends on &#8217;Change with orders to see
what they can do and to report. I then go to
Birchin Lane and repeat the performance there
without variation. Then I call at the City office
of the <i>Evening Messenger</i> and talk privily in a
despondent vein with the financial editor concerning
the Trust, but I breathe not a word as to Mr.
Rainshore&#8217;s disappearance. Wednesday morning.&mdash;The
rot in Dry Goods has set in sharply, but I
am now, very foolishly, disposed to haggle about
the selling price. Our friends urge me to accept
what I can get, and I leave them, saying that I must
telegraph to you. Wednesday afternoon.&mdash;I see
a reporter of the <i>Morning Journal</i> and let out that
Simeon Rainshore has disappeared. The <i>Journal</i>
will wire to Ostend for confirmation, which confirmation
it will receive. Thursday morning.&mdash;The
bottom is knocked out of the price of Dry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
Goods shares. Then I am to call on our other
friends in Throgmorton Street and tell them to
buy, buy, buy, in London, New York, Paris,
everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go in peace,&#8221; said Cecil. &#8220;If we are
lucky, the price will drop to seventy.&#8221;</p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p>&#8220;I see, Mr. Thorold,&#8221; said Geraldine Rainshore,
&#8220;that you are about to ask me for the
next dance. It is yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the queen of diviners,&#8221; Cecil replied,
bowing.</p>

<p>It was precisely half-past nine on Thursday
evening, and they had met in a corner of the
pillared and balconied <i>salle de danse</i>, in the
Kursaal behind the concert-hall. The slippery,
glittering floor was crowded with dancers&mdash;the
men in ordinary evening dress, the women very
variously attired, save that nearly all wore picture-hats.
Geraldine was in a white frock, high
at the neck, with a large hat of black velvet;
and amidst that brilliant, multicoloured, light-hearted
throng, lit by the blaze of the electric
chandeliers and swayed by the irresistible
melody of the &#8220;Doctrinen&#8221; waltz, the young
girl, simply dressed as she was, easily held her
own.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve come back from Brussels?&#8221;
Cecil said, taking her arm and waist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. We arrived just on time for dinner.
But what have you been doing with father?
We&#8217;ve seen nothing of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Cecil mysteriously. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
been on a little voyage, and, like you, we&#8217;ve only
just returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the <i>Claribel</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have waited,&#8221; she pouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you wouldn&#8217;t have liked it. Things
happened, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what? Do tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you left your poor father alone, and
he was moping all day on Tuesday. So on Tuesday
night I had the happy idea of going out in
the yacht to witness a sham night attack by the
French Channel Squadron on Calais. I caught
your honoured parent just as he was retiring to
bed, and we went. He was only too glad. But
we hadn&#8217;t left the harbour much more than
an hour and a half when our engines broke
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What fun! And at night, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Wasn&#8217;t it? The shaft was broken.
So we didn&#8217;t see much of any night attack on
Calais. Fortunately the weather was all that the
weather ought to be when a ship&#8217;s engines break<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
down. Still, it took us over forty hours to repair&mdash;over
forty hours! I&#8217;m proud we were able to
do the thing without being ignominiously towed
into port. But I fear your father may have grown
a little impatient, though we had excellent views
of Ostend and Dunkirk, and the passing vessels
were a constant diversion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was there plenty to eat?&#8221; Geraldine asked
simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ample.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then father wouldn&#8217;t really mind. When
did you land?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About an hour ago. Your father did not expect
you to-night, I fancy. He dressed and went
straight to the tables. He has to make up for a
night lost, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>They danced in silence for a few moments, and
then suddenly Geraldine said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you excuse me? I feel tired. Good
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clock under the orchestra showed seventeen
minutes to ten.</p>

<p>&#8220;Instantly?&#8221; Cecil queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Instantly.&#8221; And the girl added, with a hint
of mischief in her voice, as she shook hands: &#8220;I
look on you as quite a friend since our last little
talk; so you will excuse this abruptness, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was about to answer when a sort of commotion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
arose near behind them. Still holding
her hand he turned to look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s your mother! She
must be unwell!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Rainshore, stout, and robed, as always,
in tight, sumptuous black, sat among a little bevy
of chaperons. She held a newspaper in trembling
hands, and she was uttering a succession of staccato
&#8220;Oh-oh&#8217;s,&#8221; while everyone in the vicinity
gazed at her with alarm. Then she dropped the
paper, and, murmuring, &#8220;Simeon&#8217;s dead!&#8221; sank
gently to the polished floor just as Cecil and Geraldine
approached.</p>

<p>Geraldine&#8217;s first instinctive move was to seize
the newspaper, which was that day&#8217;s Paris edition
of the <i>New York Herald</i>. She read the headlines
in a flash: &#8220;Strange disappearance of Simeon
Rainshore. Suicide feared. Takes advantage of
his family&#8217;s absence. Heavy drop in Dry Goods.
Shares at 72 and still falling.&#8221;</p>


<h4>VI.</h4>

<p>&#8220;My good Rebecca, I assure you that I am
alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was Mr. Rainshore&#8217;s attempt to calm the
hysteric sobbing of his wife, who had recovered
from her short swoon in the little retreat of the
person who sold Tauchnitzes, picture-postcards,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
and French novels, between the main corridor
and the reading-rooms. Geraldine and Cecil
were also in the tiny chamber.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for this,&#8221; Simeon continued, kicking the
newspaper, &#8220;it&#8217;s a singular thing that a man can&#8217;t
take a couple of days off without upsetting the
entire universe. What should you do in my
place, Thorold? This is the fault of your shaft.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should buy Dry Goods shares,&#8221; said Cecil.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an imperative knock at the door.
An official of police entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur Ryneshor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have received telegraphs from New York
and Londres to demand if you are dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not. I still live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Monsieur&#8217;s hat has been found on the
beach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My hat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It carries Monsieur&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it isn&#8217;t mine, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mais comment donc&mdash;&mdash;?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you it isn&#8217;t mine, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be angry, Simeon,&#8221; his wife pleaded
between her sobs.</p>

<p>The exit of the official was immediately followed
by another summons for admission, even
more imperative. A lady entered and handed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
to Simeon a card: &#8220;Miss Eve Fincastle. <i>The
Morning Journal.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My paper&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish to know if I exist, madam!&#8221; said
Simeon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Miss Fincastle caught sight of Cecil
Thorold, paused, and bowed stiffly. Cecil bowed;
he also blushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I continue to exist, madam,&#8221; Simeon proceeded.
&#8220;I have not killed myself. But homicide
of some sort is not improbable if&mdash;&mdash; In
short, madam, good night!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Fincastle, with a long, searching, silent
look at Cecil, departed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bolt that door,&#8221; said Simeon to his daughter.</p>

<p>Then there was a third knock, followed by a
hammering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away!&#8221; Simeon commanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the door!&#8221; pleaded a muffled voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Harry!&#8221; Geraldine whispered solemnly
in Cecil&#8217;s ear. &#8220;Please go and calm him. Tell
him I say it&#8217;s too late to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil went, astounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened to Geraldine?&#8221; cried the
boy, extremely excited, in the corridor. &#8220;There
are all sorts of rumours. Is she ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil gave an explanation, and in his turn asked
for another one. &#8220;You look unnerved,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;What are you doing here? What is it? Come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
and have a drink. And tell me all, my young
friend.&#8221; And when, over cognac, he had learnt
the details of a scheme which had no connection
with his own, he exclaimed, with the utmost
sincerity: &#8220;The minx! The minx!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; inquired Harry Vaux-Lowry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that you and the minx have had the
nearest possible shave of ruining your united
careers. Listen to me. Give it up, my boy.
I&#8217;ll try to arrange things. You delivered a letter
to the father-in-law of your desire a few days ago.
I&#8217;ll give you another one to deliver, and I fancy
the result will be, different.&#8221;</p>

<p>The letter which Cecil wrote ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Rainshore</span>,&mdash;I enclose cheque for
&pound;100,000. It represents parts of the gold that can
be picked up on the gold coast by putting out
one&#8217;s hand&mdash;so! You will observe that it is dated
the day after the next settling-day of the London
Stock Exchange. I contracted on Monday last
to sell you 25,000 shares of a certain Trust at 93&#8540;,
I did not possess the shares then, but my agents
have to-day bought them for me at an average
price of 72. I stand to realise, therefore, rather
more than half a million dollars. The round
half-million Mr. Vaux-Lowry happens to bring
you in his pocket; you will not forget your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
promise to him that when he did so you would
consider his application favourably. I wish to
make no profit out of the little transaction, but I
will venture to keep the balance for out-of-pocket
expenses, such as mending the <i>Claribel&#8217;s</i>
shaft. (How convenient it is to have a yacht
that will break down when required!) The
shares will doubtless recover in due course, and I
hope the reputation of the Trust may not suffer,
and that for the sake of old times with my father
you will regard the episode in its proper light and
bear me no ill-will.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">C. Thorold</span>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The next day the engagement of Mr. Harry
Nigel Selincourt Vaux-Lowry and Miss Geraldine
Rainshore was announced to two continents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

A BRACELET AT BRUGES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bracelet had fallen into the canal.</p>

<p>And the fact that the canal was the most picturesque
canal in the old Flemish city of Bruges,
and that the ripples caused by the splash of the
bracelet had disturbed reflections of wondrous
belfries, towers, steeples, and other unique examples
of Gothic architecture, did nothing whatever
to assuage the sudden agony of that disappearance.
For the bracelet had been given to
Kitty Sartorius by her grateful and lordly manager,
Lionel Belmont (U.S.A.), upon the completion
of the unexampled run of &#8220;The Delmonico
Doll,&#8221; at the Regency Theatre, London. And
its diamonds were worth five hundred pounds, to
say nothing of the gold.</p>

<p>The beautiful Kitty, and her friend Eve Fincastle,
the journalist, having exhausted Ostend,
had duly arrived at Bruges in the course of their
holiday tour. The question of Kitty&#8217;s jewellery
had arisen at the start. Kitty had insisted that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
she must travel with all her jewels, according to
the custom of the theatrical stars of great magnitude.
Eve had equally insisted that Kitty must
travel without jewels, and had exhorted her to
remember the days of her simplicity. They
compromised. Kitty was allowed to bring the
bracelet, but nothing else save the usual half-dozen
rings. The ravishing creature could not
have persuaded herself to leave the bracelet behind,
because it was so recent a gift and still new
and strange and heavenly to her. But, since
prudence forbade even Kitty to let the trifle lie
about in hotel bedrooms, she was obliged always
to wear it. And she had been wearing it this
bright afternoon in early October, when the girls,
during a stroll, had met one of their new friends,
Madame Lawrence, on the world-famous Quai
du Rosaire, just at the back of the H&ocirc;tel de Ville
and the Halles.</p>

<p>Madame Lawrence resided permanently in
Bruges. She was between twenty-five and forty-five,
dark, with the air of continually subduing
a natural instinct to dash, and well dressed in
black. Equally interested in the peerage and in
the poor, she had made the acquaintance of Eve
and Kitty at the H&ocirc;tel de la Grande Place, where
she called from time to time to induce English
travellers to buy genuine Bruges lace, wrought
under her own supervision by her own paupers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
She was Belgian by birth, and when complimented
on her fluent and correct English, she gave all
the praise to her deceased husband, an English
barrister. She had settled in Bruges like many
people settle there, because Bruges is inexpensive,
picturesque, and inordinately respectable. Besides
an English church and chaplain, it has two
cathedrals and an episcopal palace, with a real
bishop in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an exquisite bracelet! May I look
at it?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was these simple but ecstatic words, spoken
with Madame Lawrence&#8217;s charming foreign accent,
which had begun the tragedy. The three
women had stopped to admire the always admirable
view from the little quay, and they were
leaning over the rails when Kitty unclasped the
bracelet for the inspection of the widow. The
next instant there was a <i>plop</i>, an affrighted exclamation
from Madame Lawrence in her native
tongue, and the bracelet was engulfed before the
very eyes of all three.</p>

<p>The three looked at each other non-plussed.
Then they looked around, but not a single person
was in sight. Then, for some reason which,
doubtless, psychology can explain, they stared
hard at the water, though the water there was
just as black and foul as it is everywhere else
in the canal system of Bruges.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>&#8220;Surely you&#8217;ve not dropped it!&#8221; Eve Fincastle
exclaimed in a voice of horror. Yet she
knew positively that Madame Lawrence had.</p>

<p>The delinquent took a handkerchief from her
muff and sobbed into it. And between her sobs
she murmured: &#8220;We must inform the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; said Kitty, with the lightness
of one to whom a five-hundred-pound bracelet
is a bagatelle. &#8220;They&#8217;ll fish it up in no time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Eve decided, &#8220;you go to the police
at once, Kitty; and Madame Lawrence will go
with you, because she speaks French, and I&#8217;ll
stay here to mark the exact spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other two started, but Madame Lawrence,
after a few steps, put her hand to her side. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t,&#8221; she sighed, pale. &#8220;I am too upset. I
cannot walk. You go with Miss Sartorius,&#8221; she
said to Eve, &#8220;and I will stay,&#8221; and she leaned
heavily against the railings.</p>

<p>Eve and Kitty ran off, just as if it was an affair
of seconds, and the bracelet had to be saved from
drowning. But they had scarcely turned the
corner, thirty yards away, when they reappeared
in company with a high official of police, whom,
by the most lucky chance in the world, they
had encountered in the covered passage leading
to the Place du Bourg. This official, instantly
enslaved by Kitty&#8217;s beauty, proved to be the
very mirror of politeness and optimism. He took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
their names and addresses, and a full description
of the bracelet, and informed them that at that
place the canal was nine feet deep. He said that
the bracelet should undoubtedly be recovered on
the morrow, but that, as dusk was imminent, it
would be futile to commence angling that night.
In the meantime the loss should be kept secret;
and to make all sure, a succession of gendarmes
should guard the spot during the night.</p>

<p>Kitty grew radiant, and rewarded the gallant
officer with smiles; Eve was satisfied, and the face
of Madame Lawrence wore a less mournful hue.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Kitty to Madame, when
everything had been arranged, and the first of
the gendarmes was duly installed at the exact spot
against the railings, &#8220;you must come and take
tea with us in our winter garden; and be gay!
Smile: I insist. And I insist that you don&#8217;t
worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Lawrence tried feebly to smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very good-natured,&#8221; she stammered.</p>

<p>Which was decidedly true.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>The winter-garden of the H&ocirc;tel de la Grande
Place, referred to in all the hotel&#8217;s advertisements,
was merely the inner court of the hotel, roofed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
by glass at the height of the first storey. Cane
flourished there, in the shape of lounge-chairs,
but no other plant. One of the lounge-chairs
was occupied when, just as the carillon in the
belfry at the other end of the Place began to play
Gounod&#8217;s &#8220;Nazareth,&#8221; indicating the hour of
five o&#8217;clock, the three ladies entered the winter-garden.
Apparently the toilettes of two of them
had been adjusted and embellished as for a somewhat
ceremonious occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lo!&#8221; cried Kitty Sartorius, when she perceived
the occupant of the chair, &#8220;the millionaire!
Mr. Thorold, how charming of you to reappear
like this! I invite you to tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil Thorold rose with appropriate eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Delighted!&#8221; he said, smiling, and then
explained that he had arrived from Ostend about
two hours before and had taken rooms in the
hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew we were staying here?&#8221; Eve
asked as he shook hands with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;but I am very glad to
find you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221; She spoke languidly, but her
colour heightened and those eyes of hers sparkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame Lawrence,&#8221; Kitty chirruped, &#8220;let
me present Mr. Cecil Thorold. He is appallingly
rich, but we mustn&#8217;t let that frighten us.&#8221;</p>

<p>From a mouth less adorable than the mouth of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
Miss Sartorius such an introduction might have
been judged lacking in the elements of good form,
but for more than two years now Kitty had known
that whatever she did or said was perfectly correct
because she did or said it. The new acquaintances
laughed amiably, and a certain
intimacy was at once established.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I order tea, dear?&#8221; Eve suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear,&#8221; said Kitty quietly. &#8220;We will
wait for the Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Count?&#8221; demanded Cecil Thorold.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Comte d&#8217;Avrec,&#8221; Kitty explained. &#8220;He
is staying here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A French nobleman, doubtless?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Kitty; and she added, &#8220;you
will like him. He is an arch&aelig;ologist, and a
musician&mdash;oh, and lots of things!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I am one minute late, I entreat pardon,&#8221;
said a fine tenor voice at the door.</p>

<p>It was the Count. After he had been introduced
to Madame Lawrence, and Cecil Thorold
had been introduced to him, tea was served.</p>

<p>Now, the Comte d&#8217;Avrec was everything that
a French count ought to be. As dark as Cecil
Thorold, and even handsomer, he was a little
older and a little taller than the millionaire, and
a short, pointed, black beard, exquisitely trimmed,
gave him an appearance of staid reliability which
Cecil lacked. His bow was a vertebrate poem,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
his smile a consolation for all misfortunes, and he
managed his hat, stick, gloves, and cup with the
dazzling assurance of a conjurer. To observe
him at afternoon tea was to be convinced that he
had been specially created to shine gloriously in
drawing-rooms, winter-gardens, and <i>tables d&#8217;h&ocirc;te</i>.
He was one of those men who always do the right
thing at the right moment, who are capable of
speaking an indefinite number of languages with
absolute purity of accent (he spoke English much
better than Madame Lawrence), and who can
and do discourse with <i>verve</i> and accuracy on all
sciences, arts, sports, and religions. In short,
he was a ph&#339;nix of a count; and this was certainly
the opinion of Miss Kitty Sartorius and of
Miss Eve Fincastle, both of whom reckoned that
what they did not know about men might be
ignored. Kitty and the Count, it soon became
evident, were mutually attracted; their souls
were approaching each other with a velocity which
increased inversely as the square of the lessening
distance between them. And Eve was watching
this approximation with undisguised interest and
relish.</p>

<p>Nothing of the least importance occurred, save
the Count&#8217;s marvellous exhibition of how to behave
at afternoon tea, until the refection was
nearly over; and then, during a brief pause in
the talk, Cecil, who was sitting to the left of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
Madame Lawrence, looked sharply round at the
right shoulder of his tweed coat; he repeated the
gesture a second and yet a third time.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter with the man?&#8221; asked
Eve Fincastle. Both she and Kitty were extremely
bright, animated, and even excited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. I thought I saw something on
my shoulder, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; said Cecil. &#8220;Ah! It&#8217;s
only a bit of thread.&#8221; And he picked off the thread
with his left hand and held it before Madame
Lawrence. &#8220;See! It&#8217;s a piece of thin black
silk, knotted. At first I took it for an insect&mdash;you
know how queer things look out of the corner
of your eye. Pardon!&#8221; He had dropped the
fragment on to Madame Lawrence&#8217;s black silk
dress. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will excuse me, kind friends,&#8221; said
Madame Lawrence, &#8220;I will go.&#8221; She spoke
hurriedly, and as though in mental distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor thing!&#8221; Kitty Sartorius exclaimed
when the widow had gone. &#8220;She&#8217;s still dreadfully
upset&#8221;; and Kitty and Eve proceeded jointly
to relate the story of the diamond bracelet, upon
which hitherto they had kept silence (though
with difficulty), out of regard for Madame Lawrence&#8217;s
feelings.</p>

<p>Cecil made almost no comment.</p>

<p>The Count, with the sympathetic excitability
of his race, walked up and down the winter-garden,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
asseverating earnestly that such clumsiness
amounted to a crime; then he grew calm and
confessed that he shared the optimism of the
police as to the recovery of the bracelet; lastly he
complimented Kitty on her equable demeanour
under this affliction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, Count,&#8221; said Cecil Thorold,
later, after they had all four ascended to the drawing-room
overlooking the Grande Place, &#8220;I was
quite surprised when I saw at tea that you had to
be introduced to Madame Lawrence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why so, my dear Mr. Thorold?&#8221; the
Count inquired suavely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I had seen you together in Ostend
a few days ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count shook his wonderful head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you have a brother&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; Cecil
paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the Count. &#8220;But it is a favourite
theory of mine that everyone has his double somewhere
in the world.&#8221; Previously the Count had
been discussing Planchette&mdash;he was a great authority
on the supernatural, the sub-conscious, and
the subliminal. He now deviated gracefully to
the discussion of the theory of doubles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you aren&#8217;t going out for a walk,
dear, before dinner?&#8221; said Eve to Kitty.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear,&#8221; said Kitty, positively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I shall,&#8221; said Eve.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>And her glance at Cecil Thorold intimated in
the plainest possible manner that she wished not
only to have a companion for a stroll, but to leave
Kitty and the Count in dual solitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t, if I were you, Miss Fincastle,&#8221;
Cecil remarked, with calm and studied blindness.
&#8220;It&#8217;s risky here in the evenings&mdash;with these
canals exhaling miasma and mosquitoes and bracelets
and all sorts of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take the risk, thank you,&#8221; said Eve,
in an icy tone, and she haughtily departed; she
would not cower before Cecil&#8217;s millions. As for
Cecil, he joined in the discussion of the theory of
doubles.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>On the next afternoon but one, policemen
were still fishing, without success, for the bracelet,
and raising from the ancient duct long-buried
odours which threatened to destroy the inhabitants
of the quay. (When Kitty Sartorius had
hinted that perhaps the authorities might see
their way to drawing off the water from the canal,
the authorities had intimated that the death-rate
of Bruges was already as high as convenient.)
Nevertheless, though nothing had happened, the
situation had somehow developed, and in such a
manner that the bracelet itself was in danger of
being partially forgotten; and of all places in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Bruges, the situation had developed on the
top of the renowned Belfry which dominates
the Grande Place in particular and the city
in general.</p>

<p>The summit of the Belfry is three hundred and
fifty feet high, and it is reached by four hundred
and two winding stone steps, each a separate
menace to life and limb. Eve Fincastle had
climbed those steps alone, perhaps in quest of the
view at the top, perhaps in quest of spiritual calm.
She had not been leaning over the parapet more
than a minute before Cecil Thorold had appeared,
his field-glasses slung over his shoulder. They
had begun to talk a little, but nervously and only
in snatches. The wind blew free up there among
the forty-eight bells, but the social atmosphere
was oppressive.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Count is a most charming man,&#8221; Eve
was saying, as if in defence of the Count.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is,&#8221; said Cecil; &#8220;I agree with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, you don&#8217;t, Mr. Thorold! Oh, no,
you don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then there was a pause, and the twain looked
down upon Bruges, with its venerable streets, its
grass-grown squares, its waterways, and its innumerable
monuments, spread out maplike beneath
them in the mellow October sunshine. Citizens
passed along the thoroughfare in the semblance
of tiny dwarfs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>&#8220;If you didn&#8217;t hate him,&#8221; said Eve, &#8220;you
wouldn&#8217;t behave as you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I behave, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eve schooled her voice to an imitation of
jocularity&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;All Tuesday evening, and all day yesterday,
you couldn&#8217;t leave them alone. You know you
couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Five minutes later the conversation had shifted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You actually saw the bracelet fall into the
canal?&#8221; said Cecil.</p>

<p>&#8220;I actually saw the bracelet fall into the canal.
And no one could have got it out while Kitty and
I were away, because we weren&#8217;t away half a
minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they could not dismiss the subject of the
Count, and presently he was again the topic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally it would be a good match for the
Count&mdash;for <i>any</i> man,&#8221; said Eve; &#8220;but then it
would also be a good match for Kitty. Of course,
he is not so rich as some people, but he is rich.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil examined the horizon with his glasses,
and then the streets near the Grande Place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rich, is he? I&#8217;m glad of it. By the by,
he&#8217;s gone to Ghent for the day, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he went by the 9.27, and returns by
the 4.38.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Cecil at length, handing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
glasses to Eve Fincastle, &#8220;kindly glance down
there. Follow the line of the Rue St. Nicolas.
You see the cream-coloured house with the enclosed
courtyard? Now, do you see two figures
standing together near a door&mdash;a man and a
woman, the woman on the steps? Who are
they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see very well,&#8221; said Eve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, my dear lady, you can,&#8221; said Cecil.
&#8220;These glasses are the very best. Try again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They look like the Comte d&#8217;Avrec and
Madame Lawrence,&#8221; Eve murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the Count is on his way from Ghent! I
see the steam of the 4.38 over there. The curious
thing is that the Count entered the house of
Madame Lawrence, to whom he was introduced
for the first time the day before yesterday, at ten
o&#8217;clock this morning. Yes, it would be a very
good match for the Count. When one comes to
think of it, it usually is that sort of man that contrives
to marry a brilliant and successful actress.
There! He&#8217;s just leaving, isn&#8217;t he? Now let
us descend and listen to the recital of his day&#8217;s
doings in Ghent&mdash;shall we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean to insinuate,&#8221; Eve burst out in
sudden wrath, &#8220;that the Count is an&mdash;an <i>adventurer</i>,
and that Madame Lawrence&mdash;&mdash; Oh!
Mr. Thorold!&#8221; She laughed condescendingly.
&#8220;This jealousy is too absurd. Do you suppose I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
haven&#8217;t noticed how impressed you were with
Kitty at the Devonshire Mansion that night, and
again at Ostend, and again here? You&#8217;re simply
carried away by jealousy; and you think because
you are a millionaire you must have all you want.
I haven&#8217;t the slightest doubt that the Count&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; said Cecil, &#8220;let us go down and
hear about Ghent.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes made a number of remarks (indulgent,
angry, amused, protective, admiring, perspicacious,
puzzled), too subtle for the medium
of words.</p>

<p>They groped their way down to earth in
silence, and it was in silence that they crossed the
Grande Place. The Count was seated on the <i>terrasse</i>
in front of the hotel, with a liqueur glass
before him, and he was making graceful and
expressive signs to Kitty Sartorius, who leaned
her marvellous beauty out of a first-storey window.
He greeted Cecil Thorold and Eve with an equal
grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how is Ghent?&#8221; Cecil inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you go to Ghent, after all, Count?&#8221;
Eve put in. The Comte d&#8217;Avrec looked from
one to another, and then, instead of replying, he
sipped at his glass. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t go.
The rather curious fact is that I happened to meet
Madame Lawrence, who offered to show me her
collection of lace. I have been an amateur of lace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
for some years, and really Madame Lawrence&#8217;s
collection is amazing. You have seen it? No?
You should do so. I&#8217;m afraid I have spent most
of the day there.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Count had gone to join Kitty in the
drawing-room, Eve Fincastle looked victoriously
at Cecil, as if to demand of him: &#8220;Will you
apologise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear journalist,&#8221; Cecil remarked simply,
&#8220;you gave the show away.&#8221;</p>

<p>That evening the continued obstinacy of the
bracelet, which still refused to be caught, began
at last to disturb the birdlike mind of Kitty Sartorius.
Moreover, the secret was out, and the
whole town of Bruges was discussing the episode
and the chances of success.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us consult Planchette,&#8221; said the Count.
The proposal was received with enthusiasm by
Kitty. Eve had disappeared.</p>

<p>Planchette was produced; and when asked if
the bracelet would be recovered, it wrote, under
the hands of Kitty and the Count, a trembling
&#8220;Yes.&#8221; When asked: &#8220;By whom?&#8221; it wrote
a word which faintly resembled &#8220;Avrec.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count stated that he should personally
commence dragging operations at sunrise. &#8220;You
will see,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I shall succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me try this toy, may I?&#8221; Cecil asked
blandly, and, upon Kitty agreeing, he addressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
Planchette in a clear voice: &#8220;Now, Planchette,
who will restore the bracelet to its owner?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Planchette wrote &#8220;Thorold,&#8221; but in characters
as firm and regular as those of a copy-book.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Thorold is laughing at us,&#8221; observed the
Count, imperturbably bland.</p>

<p>&#8220;How horrid you are, Mr. Thorold!&#8221; Kitty
exclaimed.</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>Of the four persons more or less interested in
the affair, three were secretly active that night, in
and out of the hotel. Only Kitty Sartorius, chief
mourner for the bracelet, slept placidly in her bed.
It was towards three o&#8217;clock in the morning that
a sort of preliminary crisis was reached.</p>

<p>From the multiplicity of doors which ventilate
its rooms, one would imagine that the average
foreign hotel must have been designed immediately
after its architect had been to see a Palais
Royal farce, in which every room opens into every
other room in every act. The H&ocirc;tel de la Grande
Place was not peculiar in this respect; it abounded
in doors. All the chambers on the second storey,
over the public rooms, fronting the Place, communicated
one with the next, but naturally most
of the communicating doors were locked. Cecil
Thorold and the Comte d&#8217;Avrec had each a bedroom
and a sitting-room on that floor. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Count&#8217;s sitting-room adjoined Cecil&#8217;s; and the
door between was locked, and the key in the possession
of the landlord.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at three a.m. this particular
door opened noiselessly from Cecil&#8217;s side, and
Cecil entered the domain of the Count. The
moon shone, and Cecil could plainly see not only
the silhouette of the Belfry across the Place, but
also the principal objects within the room. He
noticed the table in the middle, the large easy-chair
turned towards the hearth, the old-fashioned sofa;
but not a single article did he perceive
which might have been the personal property
of the Count. He cautiously passed across the
room through the moonlight to the door of the
Count&#8217;s bedroom, which apparently, to his immense
surprise, was not only shut, but locked, and
the key in the lock on the sitting-room side.
Silently unlocking it, he entered the bedroom and
disappeared....</p>

<p>In less than five minutes he crept back into the
Count&#8217;s sitting-room, closed the door and locked it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Odd!&#8221; he murmured reflectively; but he
seemed quite happy.</p>

<p>There was a sudden movement in the region
of the hearth, and a form rose from the armchair.
Cecil rushed to the switch and turned on the
electric light. Eve Fincastle stood before him.
They faced each other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>&#8220;What are you doing here at this time, Miss
Fincastle?&#8221; he asked, sternly. &#8220;You can talk
freely; the Count will not waken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may ask you the same question,&#8221; Eve replied,
with cold bitterness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me. You may not. You are a
woman. This is the Count&#8217;s room&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in error,&#8221; she interrupted him. &#8220;It
is not the Count&#8217;s room. It is mine. Last night
I told the Count I had some important writing to
do, and I asked him as a favour to relinquish this
room to me for twenty-four hours. He very
kindly consented. He removed his belongings,
handed me the key of that door, and the transfer
was made in the hotel books. And now,&#8221; she
added, &#8220;may I inquire, Mr. Thorold, what you
are doing in my room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I thought it was the Count&#8217;s,&#8221; Cecil
faltered, decidedly at a loss for a moment. &#8220;In
offering my humblest apologies, permit me to
say that I admire you, Miss Fincastle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could return the compliment,&#8221; Eve
exclaimed, and she repeated with almost plaintive
sincerity: &#8220;I do wish I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil raised his arms and let them fall to his
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;You meant to catch me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
suspected something, then? The &#8216;important
writing&#8217; was an invention.&#8221; And he added, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
a faint smile: &#8220;You really ought not to have
fallen asleep. Suppose I had not wakened you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t laugh, Mr. Thorold. Yes, I
did suspect. There was something in the demeanour
of your servant Lecky that gave me the
idea... I did mean to catch you. Why you, a
millionaire, should be a burglar, I cannot understand.
I never understood that incident at the
Devonshire Mansion; it was beyond me. I am
by no means sure that you didn&#8217;t have a great deal
to do with the Rainshore affair at Ostend. But
that you should have stooped to slander is the
worst. I confess you are a mystery. I confess
that I can make no guess at the nature of your
present scheme. And what I shall do, now that
I have caught you, I don&#8217;t know. I can&#8217;t decide;
I must think. If, however, anything is missing
to-morrow morning, I shall be bound in any case
to denounce you. You grasp that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I grasp it perfectly, my dear journalist,&#8221;
Cecil replied. &#8220;And something will not improbably
be missing. But take the advice of a burglar
and a mystery, and go to bed, it is half-past three.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Eve went. And Cecil bowed her out and
then retired to his own rooms. And the Count&#8217;s
apartment was left to the moonlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p>&#8220;Planchette is a very safe prophet,&#8221; said Cecil
to Kitty Sartorius the next morning, &#8220;provided
it has firm guidance.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were at breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that Planchette prophesied last night
that I should restore to you your bracelet. I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took the lovely gewgaw from his pocket
and handed it to Kitty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho-ow did you find it, you dear thing?&#8221;
Kitty stammered, trembling under the shock of
joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fished it up out&mdash;out of the mire by a contrivance
of my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But when?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Very early. At three o&#8217;clock a.m.
You see, I was determined to be first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the dark, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a light. Don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;m rather
clever?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty&#8217;s scene of ecstatic gratitude does not
come into the story. Suffice it to say that not until
the moment of its restoration did she realise how
precious the bracelet was to her.</p>

<p>It was ten o&#8217;clock before Eve descended.
She had breakfasted in her room, and Kitty had
already exhibited to her the prodigal bracelet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>&#8220;I particularly want you to go up the Belfry
with me, Miss Fincastle,&#8221; Cecil greeted her; and
his tone was so serious and so urgent that she
consented. They left Kitty playing waltzes on
the piano in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, O man of mystery?&#8221; Eve questioned,
when they had toiled to the summit, and
saw the city and its dwarfs beneath them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are in no danger of being disturbed
here,&#8221; Cecil began; &#8220;but I will make my explanation&mdash;the
explanation which I certainly owe you&mdash;as
brief as possible. Your Comte d&#8217;Avrec is
an adventurer (please don&#8217;t be angry), and your
Madame Lawrence is an adventuress. I knew
that I had seen them together. They work in
concert, and for the most part make a living on
the gaming-tables of Europe. Madame Lawrence
was expelled from Monte Carlo last year for being
too intimate with a croupier. You may be aware
that at a roulette-table one can do a great deal
with the aid of the croupier. Madame Lawrence
appropriated the bracelet &#8216;on her own,&#8217; as it were.
The Count (he may be a real Count, for anything
I know) heard first of that enterprise from the lips
of Miss Sartorius. He was annoyed, angry&mdash;because
he was really a little in love with your friend,
and he saw golden prospects. It is just this fact&mdash;the
Count&#8217;s genuine passion for Miss Sartorius&mdash;that
renders the case psychologically interesting.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
To proceed, Madame Lawrence became jealous.
The Count spent six hours yesterday in trying to
get the bracelet from her, and failed. He tried
again last night, and succeeded, but not too easily,
for he did not re-enter the hotel till after one
o&#8217;clock. At first I thought he had succeeded in
the daytime, and I had arranged accordingly, for
I did not see why he should have the honour and
glory of restoring the bracelet to its owner. Lecky
and I fixed up a sleeping-draught for him. The
minor details were simple. When you caught me
this morning, the bracelet was in my pocket, and
in its stead I had left a brief note for the perusal
of the Count, which has had the singular effect of
inducing him to decamp; probably he has not
gone alone. But isn&#8217;t it amusing that, since you
so elaborately took his sitting-room, he will be
convinced that you are a party to his undoing&mdash;you,
his staunchest defender?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eve&#8217;s face gradually broke into an embarrassed
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t explained,&#8221; she said, &#8220;how
Madame Lawrence got the bracelet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come over here,&#8221; Cecil answered. &#8220;Take
these glasses and look down at the Quai du Rosaire.
You see everything plainly?&#8221; Eve could, in
fact, see on the quay the little mounds of mud
which had been extracted from the canal in the
quest of the bracelet. Cecil continued: &#8220;On my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
arrival in Bruges on Monday, I had a fancy to
climb the Belfry at once. I witnessed the whole
scene between you and Miss Sartorius and
Madame Lawrence, through my glasses. Immediately
your backs were turned, Madame
Lawrence, her hands behind her, and her back
against the railing, began to make a sort of rapid,
drawing up motion with her forearms. Then I
saw a momentary glitter.... Considerably mystified,
I visited the spot after you had left it, chatted
with the gendarme on duty and got round him,
and then it dawned on me that a robbery had been
planned, prepared, and executed with extraordinary
originality and ingenuity. A long, thin
thread of black silk must have been ready tied to
the railing, with perhaps a hook at the other end.
As soon as Madame Lawrence held the bracelet
she attached the hook to it and dropped it. The
silk, especially as it was the last thing in the world
you would look for, would be as good as invisible.
When you went for the police, Madame retrieved
the bracelet, hid it in her muff, and broke off the
silk. Only, in her haste, she left a bit of silk tied
to the railing. That fragment I carried to the
hotel. All along she must have been a little uneasy
about me.... And that&#8217;s all. Except that
I wonder you thought I was jealous of the Count&#8217;s
attentions to your friend.&#8221; He gazed at her
admiringly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you are not a thief, Mr. Thorold,&#8221;
said Eve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Cecil smiled, &#8220;as for that, I left him
a couple of louis for fares, and I shall pay his hotel
bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There were notes for nearly ten thousand
francs with the bracelet. Ill-gotten gains, I am
sure. A trifle, but the only reward I shall have for
my trouble. I shall put them to good use.&#8221; He
laughed, serenely gay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

A SOLUTION OF THE ALGIERS MYSTERY.</h3>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">And</span> the launch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am unaware of the precise technical term,
sir, but the launch awaits you. Perhaps I should
have said it is alongside.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reliable Lecky hated the sea; and when
his master&#8217;s excursions became marine, he always
squinted more formidably and suddenly than
usual, and added to his reliability a certain quality
of ironic bitterness.</p>

<p>&#8220;My overcoat, please,&#8221; said Cecil Thorold,
who was in evening dress.</p>

<p>The apartment, large and low, was panelled
with bird&#8217;s-eye maple; divans ran along the walls,
and above the divans orange curtains were drawn;
the floor was hidden by the skins of wild African
animals; in one corner was a Steinway piano,
with the score of &#8220;The Orchid&#8221; open on the
music-stand; in another lay a large, flat bowl
filled with blossoms that do not bloom in England;
the illumination, soft and yellow, came from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
behind the cornice of the room, being reflected
therefrom downwards by the cream-coloured
ceiling. Only by a faintly-heard tremor of some
gigantic but repressed force, and by a very slight
unsteadiness on the part of the floor, could you
have guessed that you were aboard a steam-yacht
and not in a large, luxurious house.</p>

<p>Lecky, having arrayed the millionaire in overcoat,
muffler, crush-hat, and white gloves, drew
aside a <i>porti&egrave;re</i> and followed him up a flight of
stairs. They stood on deck, surrounded by the
mild but treacherous Algerian night. From the
white double funnels a thin smoke oozed. On the
white bridge, the second mate, a spectral figure,
was testing the engine-room signals, and the sharp
noise of the bell seemed to desecrate the mysterious
silence of the bay; but there was no other
sign of life; the waiting launch was completely
hidden under the high bows of the <i>Claribel</i>. In
distant regions of the deck, glimmering beams
came oddly up from below, throwing into relief
some part of a boat on its davits or a section of a
mast.</p>

<p>Cecil looked about him, at the serried lights
of the Boulevard Carnot, and the riding lanterns
of the vessels in the harbour. Away to the left
on the hill, a few gleams showed Mustapha Sup&eacute;rieure,
where the great English hotels are; and
ten miles further east, the lighthouse on Cape<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
Matifou flashed its eternal message to the Mediterranean.
He was on the verge of feeling poetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose anything happens while you are at
this dance, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lecky jerked his thumb in the direction of a
small steamer which lay moored scarcely a cable&#8217;s-length
away, under the eastern jetty. &#8220;Suppose&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
He jerked his thumb again in
exactly the same direction. His tone was still
pessimistic and cynical.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better fire our beautiful brass cannon,&#8221;
Cecil replied. &#8220;Have it fired three times.
I shall hear it well enough up at Mustapha.&#8221;</p>

<p>He descended carefully into the launch, and
was whisked puffingly over the dark surface of the
bay to the landing-stage, where he summoned a
fiacre.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&ocirc;tel St. James,&#8221; he instructed the driver.</p>

<p>And the driver smiled joyously; everyone who
went to the H&ocirc;tel St. James was rich and lordly,
and paid well, because the hill was long and steep
and so hard on the poor Algerian horses.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>Every hotel up at Mustapha Sup&eacute;rieure has the
finest view, the finest hygienic installation, and the
finest cooking in Algeria; in other words, each is
better than all the others. Hence the H&ocirc;tel St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
James could not be called &#8220;first among equals,&#8221;
since there are no equals, and one must be content
to describe it as first among the unequalled.
First it undoubtedly was&mdash;and perhaps will be
again. Although it was new, it had what one
visitor termed &#8220;that indefinable thing&mdash;<i>cachet</i>.&#8221;
It was frequented by the best people&mdash;namely,
the richest people, the idlest people, the most arrogant
people, the most bored people, the most
titled people&mdash;that came to the southern shores of
the Mediterranean in search of what they would
never find&mdash;an escape from themselves. It was a
vast building, planned on a scale of spaciousness
only possible in a district where commercial crises
have depressed the value of land, and it stood in
the midst of a vast garden of oranges, lemons, and
medlars. Every room&mdash;and there were three
storeys and two hundred rooms&mdash;faced south:
this was charged for in the bill. The public
rooms, Oriental in character, were immense and
complete. They included a dining-room, a drawing-room,
a reading-room, a smoking-room, a
billiard-room, a bridge-room, a ping-pong-room,
a concert-room (with resident orchestra), and a
room where Aissouias, negroes, and other curiosities
from the native town might perform before
select parties. Thus it was entirely self-sufficient,
and lacked nothing which is necessary to the
proper existence of the best people. On Thursday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
nights, throughout the season, there was a
five-franc dance in the concert-hall. You paid
five francs, and ate and drank as much as you
could while standing up at the supper-tables
arrayed in the dining-room.</p>

<p>On a certain Thursday night in early January,
this Anglo-Saxon microcosm, set so haughtily in a
French colony between the Mediterranean and the
Djujura Mountains (with the Sahara behind), was
at its most brilliant. The hotel was crammed, the
prices were high, and everybody was supremely
conscious of doing the correct thing. The dance
had begun somewhat earlier than usual, because
the eagerness of the younger guests could not
be restrained. And the orchestra seemed gayer,
and the electric lights brighter, and the toilettes
more resplendent that night. Of course, guests
came in from the other hotels. Indeed, they came
in to such an extent that to dance in the ballroom
was an affair of compromise and ingenuity. And
the other rooms were occupied, too. The bridge
players recked not of Terpsichore, the cheerful
sound of ping-pong came regularly from the ping-pong-room;
the retired Indian judge was giving
points as usual in the billiard-room; and in the
reading-room the steadfast intellectuals were
studying the <i>World</i> and the Paris <i>New York
Herald</i>.</p>

<p>And all was English and American, pure Anglo-Saxon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
in thought and speech and gesture&mdash;save
the manager of the hotel, who was Italian,
the waiters, who were anything, and the wonderful
concierge, who was everything.</p>

<p>As Cecil passed through the imposing suite of
public rooms, he saw in the reading-room&mdash;posted
so that no arrival could escape her eye&mdash;the
elegant form of Mrs. Macalister, and, by way
of a wild, impulsive freak, he stopped and talked
to her, and ultimately sat down by her side.</p>

<p>Mrs. Macalister was one of those English-women
that are to be found only in large and
fashionable hotels. Everything about her was
mysterious, except the fact that she was in search
of a second husband. She was tall, pretty, dashing,
daring, well-dressed, well-informed, and,
perhaps thirty-four. But no one had known her
husband or her family, and no one knew her
county, or the origin of her income, or how she
got herself into the best cliques in the hotel. She
had the air of being the merriest person in Algiers;
really, she was one of the saddest, for the reason
that every day left her older, and harder, and less
likely to hook&mdash;well, to hook a millionaire. She
had met Cecil Thorold at the dance of the previous
week, and had clung to him so artfully that
the coteries talked of it for three days, as Cecil
well knew. And to-night he thought he might,
as well as not, give Mrs. Macalister an hour&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
excitement of the chase, and the coteries another
three days&#8217; employment.</p>

<p>So he sat down beside her, and they talked.</p>

<p>First she asked him whether he slept on his
yacht or in the hotel; and he replied, sometimes
in the hotel and sometimes on the yacht. Then
she asked him where his bedroom was, and he
said it was on the second floor, and she settled
that it must be three doors from her own. Then
they discussed bridge, the Fiscal Inquiry, the
weather, dancing, food, the responsibilities of
great wealth, Algerian railway-travelling, Cannes,
gambling, Mr. Morley&#8217;s &#8220;Life of Gladstone,&#8221;
and the extraordinary success of the hotel. Thus,
quite inevitably, they reached the subject of the
Algiers Mystery. During the season, at any rate,
no two guests in the hotel ever talked small-talk
for more than ten minutes without reaching the
subject of the Algiers Mystery.</p>

<p>For the hotel had itself been the scene of the
Algiers Mystery, and the Algiers Mystery was at
once the simplest, the most charming, and the
most perplexing mystery in the world. One
morning, the first of April in the previous year,
an honest John Bull of a guest had come down to
the hotel-office, and laying a five-pound note before
the head clerk, had exclaimed: &#8220;I found
that lying on my dressing-table. It isn&#8217;t mine.
It looks good enough, but I expect it&#8217;s someone&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
joke.&#8221; Seven other people that day confessed
that they had found five-pound notes in their
rooms, or pieces of paper that resembled five-pound
notes. They compared these notes, and
then the eight went off in a body down to an
agency in the Boulevard de la R&eacute;publique, and
without the least demur the notes were changed
for gold. On the second of April, twelve more
people found five-pound notes in their rooms,
now prominent on the bed, now secreted&mdash;as, for
instance, under a candlestick. Cecil himself had
been a recipient. Watches were set, but with no
result whatever. In a week nearly seven hundred
pounds had been distributed amongst the guests
by the generous, invisible ghosts. It was magnificent,
and it was very soon in every newspaper
in England and America. Some of the guests
did not &#8220;care&#8221; for it; thought it &#8220;queer,&#8221; and
&#8220;uncanny,&#8221; and not &#8220;nice,&#8221; and these left. But
the majority cared for it very much indeed, and
remained till the utmost limit of the season.</p>

<p>The rainfall of notes had not recommenced
so far, in the present season. Nevertheless, the
hotel had been thoroughly well patronised from
November onwards, and there was scarcely a guest
but who went to sleep at night hoping to descry
a fiver in the morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Advertisement!&#8221; said some perspicacious
individuals. Of course, the explanation was an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
obvious one. But the manager had indignantly
and honestly denied all knowledge of the business,
and, moreover, not a single guest had caught a
single note in the act of settling down. Further,
the hotel changed hands and that manager left.
The mystery, therefore, remained, a delightful
topic always at hand for discussion.</p>

<p>After having chatted, Cecil Thorold and Mrs.
Macalister danced&mdash;two dances. And the hotel
began audibly to wonder that Cecil could be such
a fool. When, at midnight, he retired to bed,
many mothers of daughters and daughters of
mothers were justifiably angry, and consoled
themselves by saying that he had disappeared in
order to hide the shame which must have suddenly
overtaken him. As for Mrs. Macalister, she
was radiant.</p>

<p>Safely in his room, Cecil locked and wedged
the door, and opened the window and looked out
from the balcony at the starry night. He could
hear cats playing on the roof. He smiled when
he thought of the things Mrs. Macalister had
said, and of the ardour of her glances. Then he
felt sorry for her. Perhaps it was the whisky-and-soda
which he had just drunk that momentarily
warmed his heart towards the lonely
creature. Only one item of her artless gossip
had interested him&mdash;a statement that the new
Italian manager had been ill in bed all day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>He emptied his pockets, and, standing on a
chair, he put his pocket-book on the top of the
wardrobe, where no Algerian marauder would
think of looking for it; his revolver he tucked
under his pillow. In three minutes he was asleep.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>He was awakened by a vigorous pulling and
shaking of his arm; and he, who usually woke
wide at the least noise, came to his senses with
difficulty. He looked up. The electric light had
been turned on.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a ghost in my room, Mr. Thorold!
You&#8217;ll forgive me&mdash;but I&#8217;m so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Macalister, dishevelled and in
white, who stood over him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is really a bit too thick,&#8221; he thought
vaguely and sleepily, regretting his impulsive flirtation
of the previous evening. Then he collected
himself and said sternly, severely, that if
Mrs. Macalister would retire to the corridor, he
would follow in a moment; he added that she
might leave the door open if she felt afraid. Mrs.
Macalister retired, sobbing, and Cecil arose. He
went first to consult his watch; it was gone&mdash;a
chronometer worth a couple of hundred pounds.
He whistled, climbed on to a chair, and discovered
that his pocket-book was no longer in a place of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
safety on the top of the wardrobe; it had contained
something over five hundred pounds in
a highly negotiable form. Picking up his overcoat,
which lay on the floor, he found that the
fur lining&mdash;a millionaire&#8217;s fancy, which had cost
him nearly a hundred and fifty pounds&mdash;had
been cut away, and was no more to be seen.
Even the revolver had departed from under his
pillow!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;this is decidedly the
grand manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quite suddenly it occurred to him, as he noticed
a peculiar taste in his mouth, that the whisky-and-soda
had contained more than whisky-and-soda&mdash;he
had been drugged! He tried to recall the
face of the waiter who had served him. Eyeing
the window and the door, he argued that the thief
had entered by the former and departed by the
latter. &#8220;But the pocket-book!&#8221; he mused. &#8220;I
must have been watched!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Macalister, stripped now of all dash and
all daring, could be heard in the corridor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can she&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; He speculated for a moment,
and then decided positively in the negative.
Mrs. Macalister could have no design on anything
but a bachelor&#8217;s freedom.</p>

<p>He assumed his dressing-gown and slippers and
went to her. The corridor was in darkness, but
she stood in the light of his doorway.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this ghost of yours, dear
lady!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must go first,&#8221; she whimpered. &#8220;I
daren&#8217;t. It was white ... but with a black
face. It was at the window.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil, getting a candle, obeyed. And having
penetrated alone into the lady&#8217;s chamber, he perceived,
to begin with, that a pane had been pushed
out of the window by the old, noiseless device of a
sheet of treacled paper, and then, examining the
window more closely, he saw that, outside, a silk
ladder depended from the roof and trailed in the
balcony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in without fear,&#8221; he said to the trembling
widow. &#8220;It must have been someone with
more appetite than a ghost that you saw. Perhaps
an Arab.&#8221;</p>

<p>She came in, femininely trusting to him; and
between them they ascertained that she had lost
a watch, sixteen rings, an opal necklace, and some
money. Mrs. Macalister would not say how
much money. &#8220;My resources are slight,&#8221; she
remarked. &#8220;I was expecting remittances.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil thought: &#8220;This is not merely in the
grand manner. If it fulfils its promise, it will
prove to be one of the greatest things of the age.&#8221;</p>

<p>He asked her to keep cool, not to be afraid,
and to dress herself. Then he returned to his
room and dressed as quickly as he could. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
hotel was absolutely quiet, but out of the depths
below came the sound of a clock striking four.
When, adequately but not &aelig;sthetically attired, he
opened his door again, another door near by also
opened, and Cecil saw a man&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; drawled the man&#8217;s head, &#8220;excuse
me, but have <i>you</i> noticed anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been robbed!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Englishman laughed awkwardly, apologetically,
as though ashamed to have to confess
that he had been victimised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much?&#8221; Cecil inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two hundred or so. No joke, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I been robbed,&#8221; said Cecil. &#8220;Let
us go downstairs. Got a candle? These corridors
are usually lighted all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps our thief has been at the switches,&#8221;
said the Englishman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say our thieves,&#8221; Cecil corrected.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think there was more than one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think there were more than half a dozen,&#8221;
Cecil replied.</p>

<p>The Englishman was dressed, and the two
descended together, candles in hand, forgetting
the lone lady. But the lone lady had no intention
of being forgotten, and she came after
them, almost screaming. They had not reached
the ground floor before three other doors had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
opened and three other victims proclaimed themselves.</p>

<p>Cecil led the way through the splendid saloons,
now so ghostly in their elegance, which only three
hours before had been the illuminated scene of
such polite revelry. Ere he reached the entrance-hall,
where a solitary jet was burning, the assistant-concierge
(one of those officials who seem
never to sleep) advanced towards him, demanding
in his broken English what was the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;There have been thieves in the hotel,&#8221; said
Cecil. &#8220;Waken the concierge.&#8221;</p>

<p>From that point, events succeeded each other
in a sort of complex rapidity. Mrs. Macalister
fainted at the door of the billiard-room and was
laid out on a billiard-table, with a white ball
between her shoulders. The head concierge was
not in his narrow bed in the alcove by the main
entrance, and he could not be found. Nor could
the Italian manager be found (though he was supposed
to be ill in bed), nor the Italian manager&#8217;s
wife. Two stablemen were searched out from
somewhere; also a cook. And then the Englishman
who had lost two hundred or so went forth
into the Algerian night to bring a gendarme from
the post in the Rue d&#8217;Isly.</p>

<p>Cecil Thorold contented himself with talking
to people as, in ones and twos, and in various
stages of incorrectness, they came into the public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
rooms, now brilliantly lighted. All who came
had been robbed. What surprised him was the
slowness of the hotel to wake up. There were
two hundred and twenty guests in the place. Of
these, in a quarter of an hour, perhaps fifteen had
risen. The remainder were apparently oblivious
of the fact that something very extraordinary, and
something probably very interesting to them personally,
had occurred and was occurring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why! It&#8217;s a conspiracy, sir. It&#8217;s a conspiracy,
that&#8217;s what it is!&#8221; decided the Indian
judge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gang is a shorter word,&#8221; Cecil observed, and
a young girl in a macintosh giggled.</p>

<p>Sleepy <i>employ&eacute;s</i> now began to appear, and the
rumour ran that six waiters and a chambermaid
were missing. Mrs. Macalister rallied from the
billiard table and came into the drawing-room,
where most of the company had gathered. Cecil
yawned (the influence of the drug was still upon
him) as she approached him and weakly spoke.
He answered absently; he was engaged in watching
the demeanour of these idlers on the face of
the earth&mdash;how incapable they seemed of any initiative,
and yet with what magnificent Britannic
phlegm they endured the strange situation! The
talking was neither loud nor impassioned.</p>

<p>Then the low, distant sound of a cannon was
heard. Once, twice, thrice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>Silence ensued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens!&#8221; sighed Mrs. Macalister, swaying
towards Cecil. &#8220;What can that be?&#8221;</p>

<p>He avoided her, hurried out of the room, and
snatched somebody else&#8217;s hat from the hat-racks
in the hall. But just as he was turning the handle
of the main door of the hotel, the Englishman who
had lost two hundred or so returned out of the
Algerian night with an inspector of police. The
latter courteously requested Cecil not to leave the
building, as he must open the inquiry (<i>ouvrir
l&#8217;enqu&ecirc;te</i>) at once. Cecil was obliged, regretfully,
to comply.</p>

<p>The inspector of police then commenced his
labours. He telephoned (no one had thought of
the telephone) for assistance and asked the Central
Bureau to watch the railway station, the port, and
the stage coaches. He acquired the names and
addresses of <i>tout le monde</i>. He made catalogues
of articles. He locked all the servants in the ping-pong-room.
He took down narratives, beginning
with Cecil&#8217;s. And while the functionary was
engaged with Mrs. Macalister, Cecil quietly but
firmly disappeared.</p>

<p>After his departure, the affair loomed larger
and larger in mere magnitude, but nothing that
came to light altered its leading characteristics.
A wholesale robbery had been planned with the
most minute care and knowledge, and executed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
with the most daring skill. Some ten persons&mdash;the
manager and his wife, a chambermaid, six
waiters, and the concierge&mdash;seemed to have been
concerned in the enterprise, excluding Mrs. Macalister&#8217;s
Arab and no doubt other assistants. (The
guests suddenly remembered how superior the
concierge and the waiters had been to the ordinary
concierge and waiter!) At a quarter-past five
o&#8217;clock the police had ascertained that a hundred
rooms had been entered, and horrified guests were
still descending! The occupants of many rooms,
however, made no response to a summons to
awake. These, it was discovered afterwards, had
either, like Cecil, received a sedative unawares,
or they had been neatly gagged and bound. In
the result, the list of missing valuables comprised
nearly two hundred watches, eight hundred rings,
a hundred and fifty other articles of jewellery,
several thousand pounds&#8217; worth of furs, three
thousand pounds in coin, and twenty-one thousand
pounds in bank-notes and other forms
of currency. One lady, a doctor&#8217;s wife, said she
had been robbed of eight hundred pounds in
Bank of England notes, but her story obtained
little credit; other tales of enormous loss, chiefly
by women, were also taken with salt. When the
dawn began, at about six o&#8217;clock, an official examination
of the fa&ccedil;ade of the hotel indicated that
nearly every room had been invaded by the balconied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
window, either from the roof or from the
ground. But the stone flags of the terrace, and
the beautifully asphalted pathways of the garden
disclosed no trace of the plunderers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess your British habit of sleeping with
the window open don&#8217;t cut much ice to-day, anyhow!&#8221;
said an American from Indianapolis to the
company.</p>

<p>That morning no omnibus from the hotel arrived
at the station to catch the six-thirty train
which takes two days to ramble to Tunis and to
Biskra. And all the liveried porters talked together
in excited Swiss-German.</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>&#8220;My compliments to Captain Black,&#8221; said
Cecil Thorold, &#8220;and repeat to him that all I
want him to do is to keep her in sight. He needn&#8217;t
overhaul her too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely, sir.&#8221; Lecky bowed; he was pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you had better lie down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, sir, but I find a recumbent position
inconvenient. Perpetual motion seems more
agreeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil was back in the large, low room panelled
with bird&#8217;s-eye maple. Below him the power of
two thousand horses drove through the nocturnal
Mediterranean swell his <i>Claribel</i> of a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
tons. Thirty men were awake and active on board
her, and twenty slept in the vast, clean forecastle,
with electric lights blazing six inches above their
noses. He lit a cigarette, and going to the piano,
struck a few chords from &#8220;The Orchid&#8221;; but
since the music would not remain on the stand,
he abandoned that attempt and lay down on a
divan to think.</p>

<p>He had reached the harbour, from the hotel, in
twenty minutes, partly on foot at racing speed,
and partly in an Arab cart, also at racing speed.
The <i>Claribel&#8217;s</i> launch awaited him, and in another
five minutes the launch was slung to her davits,
and the <i>Claribel</i> under way. He learnt that the
small and sinister vessel, the <i>Perroquet Vert</i> (of
Oran), which he and his men had been watching
for several days, had slipped unostentatiously between
the southern and eastern jetties, had stopped
for a few minutes to hold converse with a boat
that had put off from the neighbourhood of Lower
Mustapha, and had then pointed her head north-west,
as though for some port in the province of
Oran or in Morocco.</p>

<p>And in the rings of cigarette smoke which he
made, Cecil seemed now to see clearly the whole
business. He had never relaxed his interest in
the affair of the five-pound notes. He had vaguely
suspected it to be part of some large scheme; he
had presumed, on slight grounds, a connection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
between the <i>Perroquet Vert</i> and the Italian manager
of the hotel. Nay, more, he had felt sure
that some great stroke was about to be accomplished.
But of precise knowledge, of satisfactory
theory, of definite expectation, he had had none&mdash;until
Mrs. Macalister, that unconscious and man-hunting
agent of Destiny, had fortunately wakened
him in the nick of time. Had it not been for his
flirtation of the previous evening, he might still
be asleep in his bed at the hotel.... He perceived
the entire plan. The five-pound notes had
been mysteriously scattered, certainly to advertise
the hotel, but only to advertise it for a particular
and colossal end, to fill it full and overflowing
with fat victims. The situation had been thoroughly
studied in all its details, and the task had
been divided and allotted to various brains. Every
room must have been examined, watched, and
separately plotted against; the habits and idiosyncrasy
of every victim must have been individually
weighed and considered. Nothing, no
trifle, could have been forgotten. And then some
supreme intelligence had drawn the threads together
and woven them swiftly into the pattern of
a single night, almost a single hour!... And
the loot (Cecil could estimate it pretty accurately)
had been transported down the hill to Mustapha
Inf&eacute;rieure, tossed into a boat, and so to the <i>Perroquet
Vert</i>. And the <i>Perroquet Vert</i>, with loot and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
looters on board, was bound, probably, for one
of those obscure and infamous ports of Oran or
Morocco&mdash;Tenez, Mostaganem, Beni Sar, Melilla,
or the city of Oran, or Tangier itself! He knew
something of the Spanish and Maltese dens of
Oran and Tangier, the clearing-houses for stolen
goods of two continents, and the impregnable
refuge of scores of ingenious villains.</p>

<p>And when he reflected upon the grandeur and
immensity of the scheme, so simple in its essence,
and so leisurely in its achievement, like most grand
schemes; when he reflected upon the imagination
which had been necessary even to conceive it, and
the generalship which had been necessary to its
successful conclusion, he murmured admiringly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who thought of that and did it may
be a scoundrel; but he is also an artist, and a
great one!&#8221;</p>

<p>And just because he, Cecil Thorold, was a
millionaire, and possessed a hundred-thousand-pound
toy, which could do nineteen knots an
hour, and cost fifteen hundred pounds a month
to run, he was about to defeat that great artist
and nullify that great scheme, and incidentally to
retrieve his watch, his revolver, his fur, and his
five hundred pounds. He had only to follow,
and to warn one of the French torpedo-boats
which are always patrolling the coast between
Algiers and Oran, and the bubble would burst!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>He sighed for the doomed artist; and he
wondered what that victimised crowd of European
loungers, who lounged sadly round the
Mediterranean in winter, and sadly round northern
Europe in summer, had done in their languid
and luxurious lives that they should be saved,
after all, from the pillage to which the great artist
in theft had subjected them!</p>

<p>Then Lecky re-entered the state room.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have a difficulty in keeping the
<i>Perroquet Vert</i> in sight, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Cecil. &#8220;That tub!
That coffin! You don&#8217;t mean she can do twenty
knots?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, sir. Coffin! It&mdash;I mean she&mdash;is
sinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil ran on deck. Dawn was breaking over
Matifou, and a faint, cold, grey light touched here
and there the heaving sea. His captain spoke and
pointed. Ahead, right ahead, less than a mile
away, the <i>Perroquet Vert</i> was sinking by the stern,
and even as they gazed at her, a little boat detached
itself from her side in the haze of the morning
mist; and she sank, disappeared, vanished amid
a cloud of escaping steam. They were four miles
north-east of Cape Caxine. Two miles further
westward, a big Dominion liner, bound direct for
Algiers from the New World, was approaching and
had observed the catastrophe&mdash;for she altered her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
course. In a few minutes, the <i>Claribel</i> picked up
the boat of the <i>Perroquet Vert</i>. It contained
three Arabs.</p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p>The tale told by the Arabs (two of them were
brothers, and all three came from Oran) fully
sustained Cecil Thorold&#8217;s theory of the spoliation
of the hotel. Naturally they pretended at first to
an entire innocence concerning the schemes of
those who had charge of the <i>Perroquet Vert</i>. The
two brothers, who were black with coal-dust
when rescued, swore that they had been physically
forced to work in the stokehold; but ultimately
all three had to admit a knowledge of things which
was decidedly incriminating, and all three got
three years&#8217; imprisonment. The only part of the
Algiers Mystery which remained a mystery was
the cause of the sinking of the <i>Perroquet Vert</i>.
Whether she was thoroughly unseaworthy (she had
been picked up cheap at Melilla), or whether someone
(not on board) had deliberately arranged her
destruction, perhaps to satisfy a Moorish vengeance,
was not ascertained. The three Arabs
could only be persuaded to say that there had been
eleven Europeans and seven natives on the ship,
and that they alone, by the mercy of Allah, had
escaped from the swift catastrophe.</p>

<p>The hotel underwent an acute crisis, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
which, however, it is emerging. For over a week
a number of the pillaged guests discussed a diving
enterprise of salvage. But the estimates were too
high, and it came to nothing. So they all, Cecil
included, began to get used to the idea of possessing
irrecoverable property to the value of
forty thousand pounds in the Mediterranean. A
superb business in telegraphed remittances was
done for several days. The fifteen beings who
had accompanied the <i>Perroquet Vert</i> to the bottom
were scarcely thought of, for it was almost universally
agreed that the way of transgressors is,
and ought to be, hard.</p>

<p>As for Cecil Thorold, the adventure, at first so
full of the promise of joy, left him melancholy,
until an unexpected sequel diverted the channel
of his thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />

IN THE CAPITAL OF THE SAHARA.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Macalister</span> turned with sudden eagerness
and alarm towards Cecil Thorold&mdash;the crowd on
the lawn in front of the railings was so dense
that only heads could be moved&mdash;and she said
excitedly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I can see my ghost across there!&#8221;</p>

<p>She indicated with her agreeable snub nose the
opposite side of the course.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your ghost?&#8221; Cecil questioned, puzzled for
a moment by this extraordinary remark.</p>

<p>Then the Arab horsemen swept by in a cloud
of dust and of thunder, and monopolised the attention
of the lawn and the grand stand, and the <i>&eacute;lite</i>
of Biskra crammed thereon and therein. They
had one more lap to accomplish for the Prix de
la Ville.</p>

<p>Biskra is an oasis in the desert, and the capital
of the Algerian Sahara. Two days&#8217; journey by
train from Algiers, over the Djujura Ranges, it is
the last outpost of the Algerian State Railways.
It has a hundred and sixty thousand palm trees;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
but the first symptom of Biskra to be observed
from the approaching first-class carriage is the
chimney of the electric light plant. Besides the
hundred and sixty thousand palm trees, it possesses
half a dozen large hotels, five native villages,
a fort, a huge barracks, a very ornamental town
hall, shops for photographic materials, a whole
street of dancing-girls, the finest winter climate in
all Africa, and a gambling Casino. It is a unique
thing in oases. It completely upsets the conventional
idea of an oasis as a pool of water bordered
with a few date palms, and the limitless desert all
round! Nevertheless, though Biskra as much resembles
Paris as it resembles the conventional
idea of an oasis, it is genuine enough, and the
limitless desert is, in fact, all around. You may
walk out into the desert&mdash;and meet a motor-car
man&#339;uvring in the sand; but the sand remains
the sand, and the desert remains the desert, and
the Sahara, more majestic than the sea itself, refuses
to be cheapened by the pneumatic tyres of
a Mercedes, or the blue rays of the electric light,
or the feet of English, French, and Germans
wandering in search of novelty&mdash;it persists in being
august.</p>

<p>Once a year, in February, Biskra becomes
really and excessively excited, and the occasion
is its annual two-day race-meeting. Then the
tribes and their chieftains and their horses and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
their camels arrive magically out of the four
corners of the desert and fill the oasis. And the
English, French, and Germans arrive from the
Mediterranean coast, with their trunks and their
civilisation, and crowd the hotels till beds in
Biskra are precious beyond rubies. And under the
tropical sun, East and West meet magnificently
in the afternoon on the racecourse to the north
of the European reserve. And the tribesmen,
their scraggy steeds trailing superb horsecloths,
are arranged in hundreds behind the motor-cars
and landaus, with the <i>pari-mutuel</i> in full swing
twenty yards away. And the dancing-girls, the
renowned Ouled-Nails, covered with gold coins
and with muslin in high, crude, violent purples,
greens, vermilions, shriek and whinny on their
benches just opposite the grand stand, where the
Western women, arrayed in the toilettes of Worth,
Doucet, and Redfern, quiz them through their
glasses. And, fringing all, is a crowd of the
adventurers and rascals of two continents, the dark
and the light. And in the background the palms
wave eternally in the breeze. And to the east
the Aur&egrave;s mountains, snow-capped, rise in hues
of saffron and pale rose, like stage mountains,
against the sapphire sky. And to the south a line
of telegraph poles lessens and disappears over the
verge into the inmost heart of the mysterious and
unchangeable Sahara.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>It was amid this singular scene that Mrs. Macalister
made to Cecil Thorold her bizarre remark
about a ghost.</p>

<p>&#8220;What ghost?&#8221; the millionaire repeated,
when the horsemen had passed.</p>

<p>Then he remembered that on the famous night,
now nearly a month ago, when the H&ocirc;tel St.
James at Algiers was literally sacked by an organised
band of depredators, and valuables to the tune
of forty thousand pounds disappeared, Mrs. Macalister
had given the first alarm by crying out
that there was a ghost in her room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; He smiled easily, condescendingly,
to this pertinacious widow, who had been pursuing
him, so fruitlessly, for four mortal weeks, from
Algiers to Tunis, from Tunis back to Constantine,
and from Constantine here to Biskra. &#8220;All
Arabs look more or less alike, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said again. &#8220;They all look alike,
to us, like Chinamen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Considering that he himself, from his own
yacht, had witnessed the total loss in the Mediterranean
of the vessel which contained the plunder
and the fleeing band of thieves; considering
that his own yacht had rescued the only three
survivors of that shipwreck, and that these survivors
had made a full confession, and had, only
two days since, been duly sentenced by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
criminal court at Algiers&mdash;he did not feel inclined
to minister to Mrs. Macalister&#8217;s feminine fancies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever see an Arab with a mole on his
chin?&#8221; asked Mrs. Macalister.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I never did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my Arab had a mole on his chin, and
that is why I am sure it was he that I saw a minute
ago&mdash;over there. No, he&#8217;s gone now!&#8221;</p>

<p>The competing horsemen appeared round the
bend for the last time, the dancing-girls whinnied
in their high treble, the crowd roared, and the
Prix de la Ville was won and lost. It was the
final race on the card, and in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> which
followed, Cecil became separated from his adorer.
She was to depart on the morrow by the six a.m.
train. &#8220;Urgent business,&#8221; she said. She had
given up the chase of the millionaire. &#8220;Perhaps
she&#8217;s out of funds, poor thing!&#8221; he reflected.
&#8220;Anyhow, I hope I may never see her
again.&#8221; As a matter of fact he never did see her
again. She passed out of his life as casually as
she had come into it.</p>

<p>He strolled slowly towards the hotel through
the perturbed crowd of Arabs, Europeans, carriages,
camels, horses and motor-cars. The
mounted tribesmen were in a state of intense excitement,
and were continually burning powder
in that mad fashion which seems to afford a
peculiar joy to the Arab soul. From time to time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
a tribesman would break out of the ranks of his
clan, and, spurring his horse and dropping the
reins on the animal&#8217;s neck, would fire revolvers
from both hands as he flew over the rough ground.
It was unrivalled horsemanship, and Cecil admired
immensely the manner in which, at the end
of the frenzied performance, these men, drunk
with powder, would wheel their horses sharply
while at full gallop, and stop dead.</p>

<p>And then, as one man, who had passed him
like a hurricane, turned, paused, and jogged back
to his tribe, Cecil saw that he had a mole on his
chin. He stood still to watch the splendid fellow,
and he noticed something far more important
than the mole&mdash;he perceived that the revolver in
the man&#8217;s right hand had a chased butt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t swear to it,&#8221; Cecil mused. &#8220;But if
that isn&#8217;t my revolver, stolen from under my
pillow at the H&ocirc;tel St. James, Algiers, on the
tenth of January last, my name is Norval, and not
Thorold.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the whole edifice of his ideas concerning
the robbery at the H&ocirc;tel de Paris began to shake.</p>

<p>&#8220;That revolver ought to be at the bottom of
the Mediterranean,&#8221; he said to himself; &#8220;and
so ought Mrs. Macalister&#8217;s man with the mole,
according to the accepted theory of the crime and
the story of the survivors of the shipwreck of the
<i>Perroquet Vert</i>.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>He walked on, keeping the man in sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; he murmured&mdash;&#8220;suppose all that
stuff isn&#8217;t at the bottom of the Mediterranean
after all?&#8221;</p>

<p>A hundred yards further on, he happened to
meet one of the white-clad native guides attached
to the Royal Hotel where he had lunched. The
guide saluted and offered service, as all the Biskra
guides do on all occasions. Cecil&#8217;s reply was to
point out the man with the mole.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see him, Mahomet,&#8221; said Cecil.
&#8220;Make no mistake. Find out what tribe he
belongs to, where he comes from, and where he
sleeps in Biskra, and I will give you a sovereign.
Meet me at the Casino to-night at ten.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mahomet grinned an honest grin and promised
to earn the sovereign.</p>

<p>Cecil stopped an empty landau and drove
hurriedly to the station to meet the afternoon
train from civilisation. He had arrived in Biskra
that morning by road from El Kantara, and Lecky
was coming by the afternoon train with the luggage.
On seeing him, he gave that invaluable
factotum some surprising orders.</p>

<p>In addition to Lecky, the millionaire observed
among the passengers descending from the train
two other people who were known to him; but
he carefully hid himself from these ladies. In
three minutes he had disappeared into the nocturnal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
whirl and uproar of Biskra, solely bent on
proving or disproving the truth of a brand-new
theory concerning the historic sack of the H&ocirc;tel
St. James.</p>

<p>But that night he waited in vain for Mahomet
at the packed Casino, where the Arab chieftains
and the English gentlemen, alike in their tremendous
calm, were losing money at <i>petits chevaux</i>
with all the imperturbability of stone statues.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>Nor did Cecil see anything of Mahomet during
the next day, and he had reasons for not making
inquiries about him at the Royal Hotel. But at
night, as he was crossing the deserted market,
Mahomet came up to him suddenly out of nowhere,
and, grinning the eternal, honest, foolish
grin, said in his odd English&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have found&mdash;him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said Mahomet, mysteriously. The
Eastern guide loves to be mysterious.</p>

<p>Cecil followed him far down the carnivalesque
street of the Ouled-Nails, where tom-toms and
nameless instruments of music sounded from every
other house, and the <i>premi&egrave;res danseuses</i> of the
Sahara showed themselves gorgeously behind
grilles, like beautiful animals in cages. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
Mahomet entered a crowded <i>caf&eacute;</i>, passed through
it, and pushing aside a suspended mat at the
other end, bade Cecil proceed further. Cecil
touched his revolver (his new revolver), to make
sure of its company, and proceeded further. He
found himself in a low Oriental room, lighted
by an odorous English lamp with a circular wick,
and furnished with a fine carpet and two bedroom
chairs certainly made in Curtain Road,
Shoreditch&mdash;a room characteristic of Biskra. On
one chair sat a man. But this person was not Mrs.
Macalister&#8217;s man with a mole. He was obviously
a Frenchman, by his dress, gestures, and
speech. He greeted the millionaire in French
and then dropped into English&mdash;excellently grammatical
and often idiomatic English, spoken with
a strong French accent. He was rather a little
man, thin, grey, and vivacious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give yourself the pain of sitting down,&#8221; said
the Frenchman. &#8220;I am glad to see you. You
may be able to help us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the advantage of me,&#8221; Cecil replied,
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said the Frenchman. &#8220;You came
to Biskra yesterday, Mr. Thorold, with the intention
of staying at the Royal Hotel, where rooms
were engaged for you. But yesterday afternoon
you went to the station to meet your servant, and
you ordered him to return to Constantine with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
your luggage and to await your instructions there.
You then took a handbag and went to the Casino
Hotel, and you managed, by means of diplomacy
and of money, to get a bed in the <i>salle &agrave; manger</i>.
It was all they could do for you. You gave the
name of Collins. Biskra, therefore, is not officially
aware of the presence of Mr. Cecil Thorold,
the millionaire; while Mr. Collins is free to carry
on his researches, to appear and to disappear as it
pleases him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Cecil remarked. &#8220;You have got that
fairly right. But may I ask&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us come to business at once,&#8221; said the
Frenchman, politely interrupting him. &#8220;Is this
your watch?&#8221;</p>

<p>He dramatically pulled a watch and chain
from his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said Cecil quietly. He refrained from
embroidering the affirmative with exclamations.
&#8220;It was stolen from my bedroom at the H&ocirc;tel St.
James, with my revolver, some fur, and a quantity
of money, on the tenth of January.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are surprised to find it is not sunk in
the Mediterranean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty hours ago I should have been surprised,&#8221;
said Cecil. &#8220;Now I am not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why not now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I have formed a new theory. But
have the goodness to give me the watch.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>&#8220;I cannot,&#8221; said the Frenchman, graciously.
&#8220;Not at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause. The sound of music was
heard from the <i>caf&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear sir, I insist.&#8221; Cecil spoke
positively.</p>

<p>The Frenchman laughed. &#8220;I will be perfectly
frank with you, Mr. Thorold. Your cleverness
in forming a new theory of the great robbery
merits all my candour. My name is Sylvain,
and I am head of the detective force of Algiers,
<i>chef de la suret&eacute;</i>. You will perceive that I cannot
part with the watch without proper formalities.
Mr. Thorold, the robbery at the H&ocirc;tel St. James
was a work of the highest criminal art. Possibly
I had better tell you the nature of our recent discoveries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I always thought well of the robbery,&#8221; Cecil
observed, &#8220;and my opinion of it is rising. Pray
continue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;According to your new theory, Mr. Thorold,
how many persons were on board the <i>Perroquet
Vert</i> when she began to sink?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three,&#8221; said Cecil promptly, as though
answering a conundrum.</p>

<p>The Frenchman beamed. &#8220;You are admirable,&#8221;
he exclaimed. &#8220;Yes, instead of eighteen,
there were three. The wreck of the <i>Perroquet
Vert</i> carefully pre-arranged; the visit of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
boat to the <i>Perroquet Vert</i> off Mustapha Inf&eacute;rieure
was what you call, I believe, a &#8216;plant.&#8217;
The stolen goods never left dry land. There
were three Arabs only on the <i>Perroquet Vert</i>&mdash;one
to steer her, and the other two in the engine-room.
And these three were very careful to get themselves
saved. They scuttled their ship in sight of your
yacht and of another vessel. There is no doubt,
Mr. Thorold,&#8221; the Frenchman smiled with a hint
of irony, &#8220;that the thieves were fully <i>au courant</i>
of your doings on the <i>Claribel</i>. The shipwreck
was done deliberately, with you and your yacht
for an audience. It was a masterly stroke,&#8221; he
proceeded, almost enthusiastically, &#8220;for it had the
effect, not merely of drawing away suspicion from
the true direction, but of putting an end to all
further inquiries. Were not the goods at the
bottom of the sea, and the thieves drowned? What
motive could the police have for further activity?
In six months&mdash;nay, three months&mdash;all the notes
and securities could be safely negotiated, because
no measures would have to be taken to stop them.
Why take measures to stop notes that are at the
bottom of the sea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the three survivors who are now in
prison,&#8221; Cecil said. &#8220;Their behaviour, their
lying, needs some accounting for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite simple,&#8221; the Frenchman went on.
&#8220;They are in prison for three years. What is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
that to an Arab? He will suffer it with stoicism.
Say that ten thousand francs are deposited with
each of their families. When they come out,
they are rich for life. At a cost of thirty thousand
francs and the price of the ship&mdash;say another
thirty thousand&mdash;the thieves reasonably expected
to obtain absolute security.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a heroic idea!&#8221; said Cecil.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; said the Frenchman. &#8220;But it has
failed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Evidently. But why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you ask? You know as well as I do!
It has failed, partly because there were too many
persons in the secret, partly because of the Arab
love of display on great occasions, and partly because
of a mole on a man&#8217;s chin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, that was the man I came here
to see,&#8221; Cecil remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is arrested,&#8221; said the Frenchman curtly,
and then he sighed. &#8220;The booty was not
guarded with sufficient restrictions. It was not
kept in bulk. One thief probably said: &#8216;I cannot
do without this lovely watch.&#8217; And another said:
&#8216;What a revolver! I must have it.&#8217; Ah! The
Arab, the Arab! The Europeans ought to have
provided for that. That is where they were foolish&mdash;the
idiots! The idiots!&#8221; he repeated angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem annoyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Thorold, I am a poet in these things.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
It annoys me to see a fine composition ruined by
bad construction in the fifth act.... However,
as chief of the surety, I rejoice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have located the thieves and the
plunder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I have. Certainly I have captured
two of the thieves and several articles. The bulk
lies at&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He stopped and looked round.
&#8220;Mr. Thorold, may I rely on you? I know,
perhaps more than you think, of your powers.
May I rely on you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may,&#8221; said Cecil.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will hold yourself at my disposition
during to-morrow, to assist me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us take coffee. In the morning, I
shall have acquired certain precise information
which at the moment I lack. Let us take coffee.&#8221;</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>On the following morning, somewhat early,
while walking near Mecid, one of the tiny outlying
villages of the oasis, Cecil met Eve Fincastle
and Kitty Sartorius, whom he had not spoken
with since the affair of the bracelet at Bruges,
though he had heard from them and had, indeed,
seen them at the station two days before. Eve
Fincastle had fallen rather seriously ill at Mentone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
and the holiday of the two girls, which should
have finished before the end of the year, was
prolonged. Financially, the enforced leisure was
a matter of trifling importance to Kitty Sartorius,
who had insisted on remaining with her friend,
much to the disgust of her London manager.
But the journalist&#8217;s resources were less royal,
and Eve considered herself fortunate that she
had obtained from her newspaper some special
descriptive correspondence in Algeria. It was
this commission which had brought her, and Kitty
with her, in the natural course of an Algerian
tour, to Biskra.</p>

<p>Cecil was charmed to see his acquaintances;
for Eve interested him, and Kitty&#8217;s beauty (it
goes without saying) dazzled him. Nevertheless,
he had been, as it were, hiding himself, and,
in his character as an amateur of the loot of cities,
he would have preferred to have met them on
some morning other than that particular morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will go with us to Sidi Okba, won&#8217;t you,
to-day?&#8221; said Kitty, after they had talked a while.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve secured a carriage, and I&#8217;m dying for a
drive in the real, true desert.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Cecil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Eve Fincastle began, and
stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you can,&#8221; said Kitty imperiously.
&#8220;You must. We leave to-morrow&mdash;we&#8217;re only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
here for two days&mdash;for Algiers and France. Another
two days in Paris, and then London, my
darling London, and work! So it&#8217;s understood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It desolates me,&#8221; said Cecil. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t
go with you to Sidi Okba to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>They both saw that he meant to refuse them.</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles it, then,&#8221; Eve agreed quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re horrid, Mr. Thorold,&#8221; said the bewitching
actress. &#8220;And if you imagine for a
single moment we haven&#8217;t seen that you&#8217;ve been
keeping out of our way, you&#8217;re mistaken. You
must have noticed us at the station. Eve thinks
you&#8217;ve got another of your&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t, Kitty,&#8221; said Eve quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Miss Fincastle suspects that I&#8217;ve got
another of my&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he paused humorously,
&#8220;Miss Fincastle is right. I <i>have</i> got another of
my&mdash;&mdash; I throw myself on your magnanimity.
I am staying in Biskra under the name of Collins,
and my time, like my name, is not my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; Eve remarked, &#8220;we will pass
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>And they shook hands, with a certain frigidity
on the part of the two girls.</p>

<p>During the morning, M. Sylvain made no
sign, and Cecil lunched in solitude at the Dar
Eef, adjoining the Casino. The races being over,
streams of natives, with their tents and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
quadrupeds, were leaving Biskra for the desert;
they made an interminable procession which
could be seen from the window of the Dar Eef
coffee room. Cecil was idly watching this procession,
when a hand touched his shoulder. He
turned and saw a gendarme.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur Collang?&#8221; questioned the gendarme.</p>

<p>Cecil assented.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Voulez-vous avoir l&#8217;obligeance de me suivre,
monsieur?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil obediently followed, and found in the
street M. Sylvain well wrapped up, and seated
in an open carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have need of you,&#8221; said M. Sylvain. &#8220;Can
you come at once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>In two minutes they were driving away together
into the desert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our destination is Sidi Okba,&#8221; said M. Sylvain.
&#8220;A curious place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The road (so called) led across the Biskra
River (so called), and then in a straight line eastwards.
The river had about the depth of a dinner
plate. As for the road, in some parts it not only
merely failed to be a road&mdash;it was nothing but
virgin desert, intact; at its best it was a heaving
and treacherous mixture of sand and pebbles,
through which, and not over which, the two unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
horses had to drag M. Sylvain&#8217;s unfortunate
open carriage.</p>

<p>M. Sylvain himself drove.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am well acquainted with this part of the
desert,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have strange cases sometimes.
And when I am on important business,
I never trust an Arab. By the way, you have a
revolver? I do not anticipate danger, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have one,&#8221; said Cecil.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is loaded?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil took the weapon from his hip pocket and
examined it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is loaded,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed the Frenchman, and then
he turned to the gendarme, who was sitting as
impassively as the leaps and bounds of the carriage
would allow, on a small seat immediately
behind the other two, and demanded of him in
French whether his revolver also was loaded.
The man gave a respectful affirmative. &#8220;Good!&#8221;
exclaimed M. Sylvain again, and launched into a
description of the wondrous gardens of the Comte
Landon, whose walls, on the confines of the oasis,
they were just passing.</p>

<p>Straight in front could be seen a short line of
palm trees, waving in the desert breeze under the
desert sun, and Cecil asked what they were.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sidi Okba,&#8221; replied M. Sylvain. &#8220;The
hundred and eighty thousand palms of the desert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
city of Sidi Okba. They seem near to you, no
doubt, but we shall travel twenty kilometres before
we reach them. The effect of nearness is
due to the singular quality of the atmosphere. It
is a two hours&#8217; journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then do we return in the dark?&#8221; Cecil
inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we are lucky, we may return at once, and
arrive in Biskra at dusk. If not&mdash;well, we shall
spend the night in Sidi Okba. You object?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A curious place,&#8221; observed M. Sylvain.</p>

<p>Soon they had left behind all trace of the oasis,
and were in the &#8220;real, true desert.&#8221; They met
and passed native equipages and strings of camels,
and from time to time on either hand at short
distances from the road could be seen the encampments
of wandering tribes. And after interminable
joltings, in which M. Sylvain, his guest, and
his gendarme were frequently hurled at each
other&#8217;s heads with excessive violence, the short
line of palm trees began to seem a little nearer
and to occupy a little more of the horizon. And
then they could descry the wall of the city. And
at last they reached its gate and the beggars squatting
within its gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Descend!&#8221; M. Sylvain ordered his subordinate.</p>

<p>The man disappeared, and M. Sylvain and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
Cecil drove into the city; they met several carriages
of Biskra visitors just setting forth on their
return journey.</p>

<p>In insisting that Sidi Okba was a curious place,
M. Sylvain did not exaggerate. It is an Eastern
town of the most antique sort, built solely of mud,
with the simplicity, the foulness, the smells, and
the avowed and the secret horrors which might
be expected in a community which has not altered
its habits in any particular for a thousand years.
During several months of each year it is visited
daily by Europeans (its mosque is the oldest
Mohammedan building in Africa, therefore no
respectable tourist dares to miss it), and yet it
remains absolutely uninfluenced by European
notions. The European person must take his
food with him; he is allowed to eat it in the garden
of a <i>caf&eacute;</i> which is European as far as its sign
and its counter, but no further; he could not eat
it in the <i>caf&eacute;</i> itself. This <i>caf&eacute;</i> is the mark which
civilisation has succeeded in making on Sidi Okba
in ten centuries.</p>

<p>As Cecil drove with M. Sylvain through the
narrow, winding street, he acutely felt the East
closing in upon him; and, since the sun was
getting low over the palm trees, he was glad to
have the detective by his side.</p>

<p>They arrived at the wretched <i>caf&eacute;</i>. A pair-horse
vehicle, with the horses&#8217; heads towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
Biskra, was waiting at the door. Unspeakable
lanes, fetid, winding, sinister, and strangely
peopled, led away in several directions.</p>

<p>M. Sylvain glanced about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall succeed,&#8221; he murmured cheerfully.
&#8220;Follow me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And they went into the mark of civilisation,
and saw the counter, and a female creature behind
the bar, and, through another door, a glimpse
of the garden beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow me,&#8221; murmured M. Sylvain again,
opening another door to the left into a dark passage.
&#8220;Straight on. There is a room at the
other end.&#8221;</p>

<p>They vanished.</p>

<p>In a few seconds M. Sylvain returned into the
<i>caf&eacute;</i>.</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>Now, in the garden were Eve Fincastle and
Kitty Sartorius, tying up some wraps preparatory
to their departure for Biskra. They caught sight
of Cecil Thorold and his companion entering the
<i>caf&eacute;</i>, and they were surprised to find the millionaire
in Sidi Okba after his refusal to accompany them.</p>

<p>Through the back door of the <i>caf&eacute;</i> they saw
Cecil&#8217;s companion reappear out of the passage.
They saw the creature behind the counter stoop
and produce a revolver and then offer it to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
Frenchman with a furtive movement. They saw
that the Frenchman declined it, and drew another
revolver from his own pocket and winked. And
the character of the wink given by the Frenchman
to the woman made them turn pale under the
sudden, knife-like thrust of an awful suspicion.</p>

<p>The Frenchman looked up and perceived the
girls in the garden, and one glance at Kitty&#8217;s
beauty was not enough for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you keep him here a minute while I
warn Mr. Thorold?&#8221; said Eve quickly.</p>

<p>Kitty Sartorius nodded and began to smile on
the Frenchman; she then lifted her finger beckoningly.
If millions had depended on his refusal,
it is doubtful whether he would have resisted that
charming gesture. (Not for nothing did Kitty
Sartorius receive a hundred a week at the Regency
Theatre.) In a moment the Frenchman
was talking to her, and she had enveloped him in
a golden mist of enchantment.</p>

<p>Guided by a profound instinct, Eve ran up the
passage and into the room where Cecil was awaiting
the return of his M. Sylvain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come out,&#8221; she whispered passionately, as
if between violent anger and dreadful alarm.
&#8220;You are trapped&mdash;you&mdash;with your schemes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trapped!&#8221; he exclaimed, smiling. &#8220;Not at
all. I have my revolver!&#8221; His hand touched
his pocket. &#8220;By Jove! I haven&#8217;t! It&#8217;s gone!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>The miraculous change in his face was of the
highest interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come out!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Our carriage is
waiting!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the <i>caf&eacute;</i>, Kitty Sartorius was talking to the
Frenchman. She stroked his sleeve with her
gloved hand, and he, the Frenchman, still held
the revolver which he had displayed to the woman
of the counter.</p>

<p>Inspired by the consummate and swiftly
aroused emotion of that moment, Cecil snatched
at the revolver. The three friends walked hastily
to the street, jumped into the carriage, and drove
away. Already as they approached the city gate,
they could see the white tower of the Royal Hotel
at Biskra shining across the desert like a promise
of security....</p>

<p>The whole episode had lasted perhaps two
minutes, but they were minutes of such intense
and blinding revelation as Cecil had never before
experienced. He sighed with relief as he lay
back in the carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s the man,&#8221; he meditated, astounded,
&#8220;who must have planned the robbery
of the H&ocirc;tel St. James! And I never suspected
it! I never suspected that his gendarme
was a sham! I wonder whether his murder
of me would have been as leisurely and artistic
as his method of trapping me! I wonder!...<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
Well, this time I have certainly enjoyed myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he gazed at Eve Fincastle.</p>

<p>The women said nothing for a long time, and
even then the talk was of trifles.</p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p>Eve Fincastle had gone up on to the vast, flat
roof of the Royal Hotel, and Cecil, knowing that
she was there, followed. The sun had just set,
and Biskra lay spread out below them in the rich
evening light which already, eastwards, had turned
to sapphire. They could still see the line of the
palm trees of Sidi Okba, and in another direction,
the long, lonely road to Figuig, stretching across
the desert like a rope which had been flung from
heaven on the waste of sand. The Aur&egrave;s mountains
were black and jagged. Nearer, immediately
under them, was the various life of the great oasis,
and the sounds of that life&mdash;human speech, the
rattle of carriages, the grunts of camels in the camel
enclosure, the whistling of an engine at the station,
the melancholy wails of hawkers&mdash;ascended softly
in the twilight of the Sahara.</p>

<p>Cecil approached her, but she did not turn
towards him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to thank you,&#8221; he started.</p>

<p>She made no movement, and then suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
she burst out. &#8220;Why do you continue with these
shameful plots and schemes?&#8221; she demanded,
looking always steadily away from him. &#8220;Why
do you disgrace yourself? Was this another
theft, another blackmailing, another affair like
that at Ostend? Why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She stopped, deeply
disturbed, unable to control herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear journalist,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;you
don&#8217;t understand. Let me tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave her his history from the night
summons by Mrs. Macalister to that same afternoon.</p>

<p>She faced him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;You can&#8217;t
imagine&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to thank you for saving my life,&#8221; he
said again.</p>

<p>She began to cry; her body shook; she hid
her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he stammered awkwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t I who saved your life,&#8221; she said,
sobbing passionately. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t beautiful enough.
Only Kitty could have done it. Only a beautiful
woman could have kept that man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know all about it, my dear girl,&#8221; Cecil
silenced her disavowal. Something moved him
to take her hand. She smiled sadly, not resisting.
&#8220;You must excuse me,&#8221; she murmured.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not myself to-night.... It&#8217;s because of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
excitement.... Anyhow, I&#8217;m glad you haven&#8217;t
taken any &#8216;loot&#8217; this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have,&#8221; he protested. (He was surprised
to find his voice trembling.)</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This.&#8221; He pressed her hand tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That?&#8221; She looked at her hand, lying in
his, as though she had never seen it before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eve,&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About two-thirds of the loot of the H&ocirc;tel St.
James was ultimately recovered; not at Sidi
Okba, but in the cellars of the H&ocirc;tel St. James
itself. From first to last that robbery was a
masterpiece of audacity. Its originator, the <i>soi-disant</i>
M. Sylvain, head of the Algiers detective
force, is still at large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />

&#8220;LO! &#8217;TWAS A GALA NIGHT!&#8221;</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span>. And not merely Paris, but Paris <i>en f&ecirc;te</i>,
Paris decorated, Paris idle, Paris determined to
enjoy itself, and succeeding brilliantly. Venetian
masts of red and gold lined the gay pavements of
the <i>grand boulevard</i> and the Avenue de l&#8217;Op&eacute;ra;
and suspended from these in every direction,
transverse and lateral, hung garlands of flowers
whose petals were of coloured paper, and whose
hearts were electric globes that in the evening
would burst into flame. The effect of the city&#8217;s
toilette reached the extreme of opulence, for no
expense had been spared. Paris was welcoming
monarchs, and had spent two million francs in
obedience to the maxim that what is worth doing
at all is worth doing well.</p>

<p>The Grand Hotel, with its eight hundred
rooms full of English and Americans, at the upper
end of the Avenue de l&#8217;Op&eacute;ra, looked down at
the Grand H&ocirc;tel du Louvre, with its four hundred
rooms full of English and Americans, at the lower<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
end of the Avenue de l&#8217;Op&eacute;ra. These two establishments
had the best views in the whole city;
and perhaps the finest view of all was that obtainable
from a certain second floor window of the
Grand Hotel, precisely at the corner of the Boulevard
des Capucines and the Rue Auber. From
this window one could see the boulevards in both
directions, the Op&eacute;ra, the Place de l&#8217;Op&eacute;ra, the
Avenue de l&#8217;Op&eacute;ra, the Rue du Quatre Septembre,
and the multitudinous life of the vivid thoroughfares&mdash;the
glittering <i>caf&eacute;s</i>, the dazzling shops, the
painted kiosks, the lumbering omnibuses, the
gliding trams, the hooting automobiles, the swift
and careless cabs, the private carriages, the suicidal
bicycles, the newsmen, the toy sellers, the touts,
the beggars, and all the holiday crowd, sombre
men and radiant women, chattering, laughing,
bustling, staring, drinking, under the innumerable
tricolours and garlands of paper flowers.</p>

<p>That particular view was a millionaire&#8217;s view,
and it happened to be the temporary property of
Cecil Thorold, who was enjoying it and the afternoon
sun at the open window, with three companions.
Eve Fincastle looked at it with the
analytic eye of the journalist, while Kitty Sartorius,
as was quite proper for an actress, deemed it a
sort of frame for herself, as she leaned over the
balcony like a Juliet on the stage. The third guest
in Cecil&#8217;s sitting-room was Lionel Belmont, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
Napoleonic Anglo-American theatrical manager, in
whose crown Kitty herself was the chief star. Mr.
Belmont, a big, burly, good-humoured, shrewd
man of something over forty, said he had come
to Paris on business. But for two days the business
had been solely to look after Kitty Sartorius
and minister to her caprices. At the present moment
his share of the view consisted mainly of
Kitty; in the same way Cecil&#8217;s share of the
view consisted mainly of Eve Fincastle; but this
at least was right and decorous, for the betrothal
of the millionaire and the journalist had been
definitely announced. Otherwise Eve would
have been back at work in Fleet Street a week
ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gala performance is to-night, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; said Eve, gazing at the vast and superbly
ornamented Opera House.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Cecil.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a pity we can&#8217;t be there! I should so
have liked to see the young Queen in evening
dress. And they say the interior decorations&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing simpler,&#8221; said Cecil. &#8220;If you want
to go, dear, let us go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty Sartorius looked round quickly. &#8220;Mr.
Belmont has tried to get seats, and can&#8217;t. Haven&#8217;t
you, Bel? You know the whole audience is invited.
The invitations are issued by the Minister
of Fine Arts.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>&#8220;Still, in Paris, anything can be got by paying
for it,&#8221; Cecil insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear young friend,&#8221; said Lionel Belmont,
&#8220;I guess if seats were to be had, I should
have struck one or two yesterday. I put no limit
on the price, and I reckon I ought to know what
theatre prices run to. Over at the Metropolitan
in New York I&#8217;ve seen a box change hands at two
thousand dollars, for one night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Cecil began again.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the performance starting in six hours
from now!&#8221; Lionel Belmont exclaimed. &#8220;Not
much!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Cecil persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen the <i>Herald</i> to-day?&#8221; Belmont questioned.
&#8220;No? Well, listen. This will interest
you.&#8221; He drew a paper from his pocket and
read: &#8220;Seats for the Op&eacute;ra Gala. The traffic in
seats for the gala performance at the Op&eacute;ra during
the last Royal Visit to Paris aroused considerable
comment and not a little dissatisfaction.
Nothing, however, was done, and the traffic in
seats for to-night&#8217;s spectacle, at which the President
and their Imperial Majesties will be present,
has, it is said, amounted to a scandal. Of course,
the offer so suddenly made, five days ago, by
Madame F&eacute;lise and Mademoiselle Malva, the two
greatest living dramatic sopranos, to take part in
the performance, immediately and enormously intensified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
interest in the affair, for never yet have
these two supreme artists appeared in the same
theatre on the same night. No theatre could afford
the luxury. Our readers may remember that in
our columns and in the columns of the <i>Figaro</i>
there appeared four days ago an advertisement to
the following effect: &#8216;<i>A box, also two orchestra
stalls, for the Op&eacute;ra Gala, to be disposed of, owing
to illness. Apply, 155, Rue de la Paix.</i>&#8217; We sent
four several reporters to answer that advertisement.
The first was offered a stage-box for seven thousand
five hundred francs, and two orchestra stalls
in the second row for twelve hundred and fifty
francs. The second was offered a box opposite
the stage on the second tier, and two stalls in the
seventh row. The third had the chance of four
stalls in the back row and a small box just behind
them; the fourth was offered something else.
The thing was obviously, therefore, a regular
agency. Everybody is asking: &#8216;How were these
seats obtained? From the Ministry of Fine Arts,
or from the <i>invit&eacute;s</i>?&#8217; Echo answers &#8216;How?&#8217;
The authorities, however, are stated to have interfered
at last, and to have put an end to this
buying and selling of what should be an honourable
distinction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bravo!&#8221; said Cecil.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s so!&#8221; Belmont remarked, dropping
the paper. &#8220;I went to 155, Rue de la Paix<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
myself yesterday, and was told that nothing whatever
was to be had, not at any price.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you didn&#8217;t offer enough,&#8221; said Cecil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moreover, I notice the advertisement does
not appear to-day. I guess the authorities have
crumpled it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Cecil went on monotonously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said Belmont, grim and a little
nettled. &#8220;Just to cut it short, I&#8217;ll bet you a two-hundred-dollar
dinner at Paillard&#8217;s that you can&#8217;t
get seats for to-night&mdash;not even two, let alone
four.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You really want to bet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; drawled Belmont, with a certain
irony, slightly imitating Cecil&#8217;s manner, &#8220;it
means something to eat for these ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I accept,&#8221; said Cecil. And he rang the bell.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>&#8220;Lecky,&#8221; Cecil said to his valet, who had
entered the room, &#8220;I want you to go to No. 155,
Rue de la Paix, and find out on which floor they
are disposing of seats for the Op&eacute;ra to-night.
When you have found out, I want you to get me
four seats&mdash;preferably a box. Understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>The servant stared at his master, squinting
violently for a few seconds. Then he replied suddenly,
as though light had just dawned on him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
&#8220;Exactly, sir. You intend to be present at the
gala performance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have successfully grasped my intention,&#8221;
said Cecil. &#8220;Present my card.&#8221; He scribbled a
word or two on a card and gave it to the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the price, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You still have that blank cheque on the
Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais that I gave you yesterday morning.
Use that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Then there is the question of my
French, sir, my feeble French&mdash;a delicate plant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; Belmont put in. &#8220;I will accompany
you as interpreter. I should like to
see this thing through.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lecky bowed and gave up squinting.</p>

<p>In three minutes (for they had only to go round
the corner), Lionel Belmont and Lecky were in a
room on the fourth floor of 155, Rue de la Paix.
It had the appearance of an ordinary drawing-room,
save that it contained an office table; at
this table sat a young man, French.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish, messieurs?&#8221; said the young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have the goodness to interpret for me,&#8221; said
Lecky to the Napoleon of Anglo-Saxon theatres.
&#8220;Mr. Cecil Thorold, of the Devonshire Mansion,
London, the Grand Hotel, Paris, the H&ocirc;tel Continental,
Rome, and the Ghezireh Palace Hotel,
Cairo, presents his compliments, and wishes a box
for the gala performance at the Op&eacute;ra to-night.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>Belmont translated, while Lecky handed the
card.</p>

<p>&#8220;Owing to the unfortunate indisposition of a
Minister and his wife,&#8221; replied the young man
gravely, having perused the card, &#8220;it happens that
I have a stage-box on the second tier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You told me yesterday&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Belmont began.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take it,&#8221; said Lecky in a sort of French,
interrupting his interpreter. &#8220;The price? And
a pen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The price is twenty-five thousand francs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gemini!&#8221; Belmont exclaimed in American.
&#8220;This is Paris, and no mistake!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Lecky, as he filled up the blank
cheque, &#8220;Paris still succeeds in being Paris. I
have noticed it before, Mr. Belmont, if you will
pardon the liberty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man opened a drawer and handed
to Lecky a magnificent gilt card, signed by the
Minister of Fine Arts, which Lecky hid within his
breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;That signature of the Minister is genuine,
eh?&#8221; Belmont asked the young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I answer for it,&#8221; said the young man, smiling
imperturbably.</p>

<p>&#8220;The deuce you do!&#8221; Belmont murmured.</p>

<p>So the four friends dined at Paillard&#8217;s at the
rate of about a dollar and a-half a mouthful, and
the mystified Belmont, who was not in the habit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
of being mystified, and so felt it, had the ecstasy
of paying the bill.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>It was nine o&#8217;clock when they entered the
magnificent precincts of the Op&eacute;ra House. Like
everybody else, they went very early&mdash;the performance
was not to commence until nine-thirty&mdash;in
order to see and be seen to the fullest possible
extent. A week had elapsed since the two girls
had arrived from Algiers in Paris, under the escort
of Cecil Thorold, and in that time they had
not been idle. Kitty Sartorius had spent tolerable
sums at the best <i>modistes</i>, in the Rue de
la Paix and the establishments in the Rue de la
Chauss&eacute;e d&#8217;Antin, while Eve had bought one
frock (a dream, needless to say), and had also been
nearly covered with jewellery by her betrothed.
That afternoon, between the bet and the dinner,
Cecil had made more than one mysterious disappearance.
He finally came back with a diamond
tiara for his dear journalist. &#8220;You ridiculous
thing!&#8221; exclaimed the dear journalist, kissing
him. It thus occurred that Eve, usually so severe
of aspect, had more jewels than she could wear,
while Kitty, accustomed to display, had practically
nothing but her famous bracelet. Eve insisted on
pooling the lot, and dividing equally, for the gala.</p>

<p>Consequently, the party presented a very pretty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
appearance as it ascended the celebrated grand
staircase of the Op&eacute;ra, wreathed to-night in
flowers. Lionel Belmont, with Kitty on his arm,
was in high spirits, uplifted, joyous; but Cecil
himself seemed to be a little nervous, and this
nervousness communicated itself to Eve Fincastle&mdash;or
perhaps Eve was rather overpowered
by her tiara. At the head of the staircase was
a notice requesting everyone to be seated at nine-twenty-five,
previous to the arrival of the President
and the Imperial guests of the Republic.</p>

<p>The row of officials at the <i>controle</i> took the
expensive gilt card from Cecil, examined it, returned
it, and bowed low with an intimation that
he should turn to the right and climb two floors;
and the party proceeded further into the interior
of the great building. The immense corridors
and <i>foyers</i> and stairs were crowded with a collection
of the best-known people in Paris. It was a
gathering of all the renowns. The garish, gorgeous
Op&eacute;ra seemed to be changed that night into
something new and strange. Even those shabby
old harridans, the box-openers, the <i>ouvreuses</i>, wore
bows of red, white and blue, and smiled effusively
in expectation of tips inconceivably large.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Tiens!</i>&#8221; exclaimed the box-opener who had
taken charge of Cecil&#8217;s party, as she unlocked the
door of the box.</p>

<p>And well might she exclaim, for the box (No. 74&mdash;no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
possible error) was already occupied by a lady
and two gentlemen, who were talking rather loudly
in French! Cecil undoubtedly turned pale, while
Lionel Belmont laughed within his moustache.</p>

<p>&#8220;These people have made a mistake,&#8221; Cecil
was saying to the <i>ouvreuse</i>, when a male official in
evening dress approached him with an air of
importance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, monsieur. You are Monsieur Cecil
Thorold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Cecil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you kindly follow me? Monsieur the
Directeur wishes to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are expected, evidently,&#8221; said Lionel
Belmont. The girls kept apart, as girls should in
these crises between men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a ticket for this box,&#8221; Cecil remarked
to the official. &#8220;And I wish first to take possession
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is precisely that point which Monsieur
the Directeur wishes to discuss with Monsieur,&#8221;
rejoined the official, ineffably suave. He turned
with a wonderful bow to the girls, and added with
that politeness of which the French alone have
the secret: &#8220;Perhaps, in the meantime, these
ladies would like to see the view of the Avenue
de l&#8217;Op&eacute;ra from the balcony? The illuminations
have begun, and the effect is certainly charming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil bit his lip.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Belmont, take them.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, while Lionel Belmont escorted the girls to
the balcony, there to discuss the startling situation
and to watch the Imperial party drive up the
resplendent, fairy-like, and unique avenue, Cecil
followed the official.</p>

<p>He was guided along various passages and
round unnumbered corners to the rear part of the
colossal building. There, in a sumptuous bureau,
the official introduced him to a still higher official,
the Directeur, who had a decoration and a long,
white moustache.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur,&#8221; said this latter, &#8220;I am desolated
to have to inform you that the Minister of Fine
Arts has withdrawn his original invitation for Box
No. 74 to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have received no intimation of the withdrawal,&#8221;
Cecil replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Because the original invitation was
not issued to you,&#8221; said the Directeur, excited and
nervous. &#8220;The Minister of Fine Arts instructs
me to inform you that his invitation to meet the
President and their Imperial Majesties cannot be
bought and sold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But is it not notorious that many such invitations
have been bought and sold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, unfortunately, too notorious.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the Directeur looked at his watch and
rang a bell impatiently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>&#8220;Then why am I singled out?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Directeur gazed blandly at Cecil. &#8220;The
reason, perhaps, is best known to yourself,&#8221; said
he, and he rang the bell again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I appear to incommode you,&#8221; Cecil remarked.
&#8220;Permit me to retire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, I assure you,&#8221; said the Directeur.
&#8220;On the contrary. I am a little agitated on account
of the non-arrival of Mademoiselle Malva.&#8221;</p>

<p>A minor functionary entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Monsieur the Directeur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is nine-fifteen. <i>Sapristi!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The functionary departed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The invitation to Box No. 74,&#8221; proceeded
the Directeur, commanding himself, &#8220;was sold
for two thousand francs. Allow me to hand you
notes for the amount, dear monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I paid twenty-five thousand,&#8221; said
Cecil, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is conceivable. But the Minister can only
concern himself with the original figure. You
refuse the notes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By no means,&#8221; said Cecil, accepting them.
&#8220;But I have brought here to-night three guests,
including two ladies. Imagine my position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I imagine it,&#8221; the Directeur responded.
&#8220;But you will not deny that the Minister has
always the right to cancel an invitation. Seats<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
ought to be sold subject to the contingency of that
right being exercised.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment still another official plunged
into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is not here yet!&#8221; he sighed, as if in
extremity.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is unfortunate,&#8221; Cecil sympathetically
put in.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is more than unfortunate, dear monsieur,&#8221;
said the Directeur, gesticulating. &#8220;It is unthinkable.
The performance <i>must</i> begin at nine-thirty,
and it <i>must</i> begin with the garden scene from
&#8216;Faust,&#8217; in which Mademoiselle Malva takes
<i>Marguerite</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not change the order?&#8221; Cecil suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible. There are only two other items.
The first act of &#8216;Lohengrin,&#8217; with Madame
F&eacute;lise, and the ballet &#8216;Sylvia.&#8217; We cannot commence
with the ballet. No one ever heard of
such a thing. And do you suppose that F&eacute;lise
will sing before Malva? Not for millions. Not
for a throne. The etiquette of sopranos is stricter
than that of Courts. Besides, to-night we cannot
have a German opera preceding a French one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the President and their Majesties will
have to wait a little, till Malva arrives,&#8221; Cecil said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their Majesties wait! Impossible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; echoed the other official,
aghast.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>Two more officials entered. And the atmosphere
of alarm, of being scotched, of being up a
tree of incredible height, the atmosphere which
at that moment permeated the whole of the vast
region behind the scenes of the Paris Op&eacute;ra,
seemed to rush with them into the bureau of the
Directeur and to concentrate itself there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nine-twenty! And she couldn&#8217;t dress in
less than fifteen minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have sent to the H&ocirc;tel du Louvre?&#8221;
the Directeur questioned despairingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Monsieur the Directeur. She left there
two hours ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil coughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could have told you as much,&#8221; he remarked,
very distinctly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried the Directeur. &#8220;You know
Mademoiselle Malva?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is among my intimate friends,&#8221; said
Cecil smoothly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you know where she is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a most accurate idea,&#8221; said Cecil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you when I am seated in my box
with my friends,&#8221; Cecil answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear monsieur,&#8221; panted the Directeur,
&#8220;tell us at once! I give you my word of honour
that you shall have your box.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil bowed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I may remark that
I had gathered information which led me to anticipate
this difficulty with the Minister of Fine
Arts&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Malva, Malva&mdash;where is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be at ease. It is only nine-twenty-three,
and Mademoiselle Malva is less than three minutes
away, and ready dressed. I was observing that I
had gathered information which led me to anticipate
this difficulty with the Minister of Fine Arts,
and accordingly I took measures to protect myself.
There is no such thing as absolute arbitrary power,
dear Directeur, even in a Republic, and I have
proved it. Mademoiselle Malva is in room No.
429 at the Grand Hotel, across the road....
Stay, she will not come without this note.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed out a small, folded letter from his
waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>Then he added: &#8220;Adieu, Monsieur the
Directeur. You have just time to reach the State
entrance in order to welcome the Presidential and
Imperial party.&#8221;</p>

<p>At nine-thirty, Cecil and his friends were
ushered by a trinity of subservient officials into
their box, which had been mysteriously emptied
of its previous occupants. And at the same
moment the monarchs, with monarchical punctuality,
accompanied by the President, entered
the Presidential box in the middle of the grand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
tier of the superb auditorium. The distinguished
and dazzling audience rose to its feet, and the
band played the National Anthem.</p>

<p>&#8220;You fixed it up then?&#8221; Belmont whispered
under cover of the National Anthem. He was
beaten, after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; said Cecil lightly. &#8220;A trivial
misconception, nothing more. And I have made
a little out of it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed! Much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not much! Two thousand francs.
But you must remember that I have been less than
half an hour in making them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The curtain rose on the garden scene from
&#8220;Faust.&#8221;</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>


<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; said Eve.</p>

<p>When a woman has been definitely linked with
a man, either by betrothal or by marriage, there
are moments, especially at the commencement,
when she assumes an air and a tone of absolute
exclusive possession of him. It is a wonderful
trick, which no male can successfully imitate, try
how he will. One of these moments had arrived
in the history of Eve Fincastle and her millionaire
lover. They sat in a large, deserted public room,
all gold, of the Grand Hotel. It was midnight
less a quarter, and they had just returned, somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
excited and flushed, from the glories of the
gala performances. During the latter part of the
evening, Eve had been absent from Cecil&#8217;s box
for nearly half an hour.</p>

<p>Kitty Sartorius and Lionel Belmont were conversing
in an adjoining <i>salon</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Cecil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you quite, quite sure that you love me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Only one answer is possible to such a question.
Cecil gave it.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all very well,&#8221; Eve pursued with
equal gravity and charm. &#8220;But it was really
tremendously sudden, wasn&#8217;t it? I can&#8217;t think
what you see in me, dearest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Eve,&#8221; Cecil observed, holding her
hand, &#8220;the best things, the most enduring things,
very often occur suddenly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say you love me,&#8221; she persisted.</p>

<p>So he said it, this time. Then her gravity
deepened, though she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve given up all those&mdash;those schemes
and things of yours, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; she questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, I&#8217;m so glad. I never could understand
why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What was I to do? I
was rich. I was bored. I had no great attainments.
I was interested in life and in the arts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
but not desperately, not vitally. You may, perhaps,
say I should have taken up philanthropy.
Well, I&#8217;m not built that way. I can&#8217;t help it, but
I&#8217;m not a born philanthropist, and the philanthropist
without a gift for philanthropy usually does
vastly more harm than good. I might have gone
into business. Well, I should only have doubled
my millions, while boring myself all the time.
Yet the instinct which I inherited from my father,
the great American instinct to be a little cleverer
and smarter than someone else, drove me to
action. It was part of my character, and one
can&#8217;t get away from one&#8217;s character. So finally
I took to these rather original &#8216;schemes,&#8217; as you
call them. They had the advantage of being exciting
and sometimes dangerous, and though they
were often profitable, they were not too profitable.
In short, they amused me and gave me joy. They
also gave me <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eve smiled again, but without committing
herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have abandoned them now completely?&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what about this Op&eacute;ra affair to-night?&#8221;
She sprang the question on him sharply.
She did her best to look severe, but the endeavour
ended with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant to tell you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
how&mdash;how did you know? How did you
guess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget that I am still a journalist,&#8221; she
replied, &#8220;and still on the staff of my paper. I
wished to interview Malva to-night for the <i>Journal</i>,
and I did so. It was she who let out things. She
thought I knew all about it; and when she saw
that I didn&#8217;t she stopped and advised me mysteriously
to consult you for details.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the scandal at the gala performance
last autumn that gave me an action for making a
corner in seats at the very next gala performance
that should ever occur at the Paris Op&eacute;ra,&#8221; Cecil
began his confession. &#8220;I knew that seats could
be got direct from more or less minor officials at
the Ministry of Fine Arts, and also that a large
proportion of the people invited to these performances
were prepared to sell their seats. You
can&#8217;t imagine how venal certain circles are in
Paris. It just happened that the details and date
of to-night&#8217;s performance were announced on the
day we arrived here. I could not resist the
chance. Now you comprehend sundry strange
absences of mine during the week. I went to a
reporter on the <i>Echo de Paris</i> whom I knew, and
who knows everybody. And we got out a list of
the people likely to be invited and likely to be
willing to sell their seats. We also opened negotiations
at the Ministry.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>&#8220;How on earth do these ideas occur to you?&#8221;
asked Eve.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I tell?&#8221; Cecil answered. &#8220;It is
because they occur to me that I am I&mdash;you see.
Well, in twenty-four hours my reporter and two
of his friends had interviewed half the interviewable
people in Paris, and the Minister of Fine
Arts had sent out his invitations, and I had obtained
the refusal of over three hundred seats, at
a total cost of about seventy-five thousand francs.
Then I saw that my friend the incomparable
Malva was staying at the Ritz, and the keystone
idea of the entire affair presented itself to me. I
got her to offer to sing. Of course, her rival
F&eacute;lise could not be behind her in a patriotic
desire to cement the friendliness of two great
nations. The gala performance blossomed into
a terrific boom. We took a kind of office in the
Rue de la Paix. We advertised very discreetly.
Every evening, after bidding you &#8216;Good-night,&#8217;
I saw my reporter and Lecky, and arranged the
development of the campaign. In three days we
had sold all our seats, except one box, which I
kept, for something like two hundred thousand
francs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then this afternoon you merely bought the
box from yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, my love. I had meant the surprise
of getting a box to come a little later than it did&mdash;say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
at dinner; but you and Belmont, between you,
forced it on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite. The minions of the Minister of
Fine Arts were extremely cross. And they meant
to revenge themselves on me by depriving me of
my box at the last moment. However, I got
wind of that, and by the simplest possible arrangement
with Malva I protected myself. The scheme&mdash;my
last bachelor fling, Eve&mdash;has been a great
success, and the official world of Paris has been
taught a lesson which may lead to excellent
results.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you have cleared a hundred and twenty-five
thousand francs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By no means. The profits of these undertakings
are the least part of them. The expenses
are heavy. I reckon the expenses will be nearly
forty thousand francs. Then I must give Malva
a necklace, and that necklace must cost twenty-five
thousand francs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That leaves sixty thousand clear?&#8221; said Eve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say sixty-two thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was forgetting an extra two thousand made
this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your other &#8216;schemes&#8217;?&#8221; Eve continued
her cross-examination. &#8220;How much have they
yielded?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>&#8220;The Devonshire House scheme was a dead
loss. My dear, why did you lead me to destroy
that fifty thousand pounds? Waste not, want
not. There may come a day when we shall need
that fifty thousand pounds, and then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be funny,&#8221; said Eve. &#8220;I am serious&mdash;very
serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Ostend and Mr. Rainshore yielded
twenty-one thousand pounds net. Bruges and the
bracelet yielded nine thousand five hundred francs.
Algiers and Biskra resulted in a loss of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the losses,&#8221; Eve interrupted.
&#8220;Are there any more gains?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a few. At Rome last year I somehow
managed to clear fifty thousand francs. Then
there was an episode at the Chancellory at Berlin.
And&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me the total gains, my love,&#8221; said Eve&mdash;&#8220;the
gross gains.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil consulted a pocket-book.</p>

<p>&#8220;A trifle,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Between thirty-eight
and forty thousand pounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Cecil,&#8221; the girl said, &#8220;call it forty
thousand&mdash;a million francs&mdash;and give me a
cheque. Do you mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be charmed, my darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when we get to London,&#8221; Eve finished,
&#8220;I will hand it over to the hospitals anonymously.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>He paused, gazed at her, and kissed her.</p>

<p>Then Kitty Sartorius entered, a marvellous
vision, with Belmont in her wake. Kitty glanced
hesitatingly at the massive and good-humoured
Lionel.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; said Kitty, and paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are engaged,&#8221; said Lionel. &#8220;You aren&#8217;t
surprised?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our warmest congratulations!&#8221; Cecil observed.
&#8220;No. We can&#8217;t truthfully say that we
are staggered. It is in the secret nature of things
that a leading lady must marry her manager&mdash;a
universal law that may not be transgressed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moreover,&#8221; said Eve later, in Cecil&#8217;s private
ear, as they were separating for the night, &#8220;we
might have guessed much earlier. Theatrical
managers don&#8217;t go scattering five-hundred-pound
bracelets all over the place merely for business
reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he only scattered one, my dear,&#8221; Cecil
murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, well. That&#8217;s what I mean.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MR. PENFOUND&#8217;S TWO BURGLARS.</h2>
</div>

<h3>THE STORY OF HIS WALK WITH THEM.</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THE chain of circumstances leading to the
sudden and unexpected return of Mr. and
Mrs. Penfound from their Continental holiday
was in itself curious and even remarkable, but it
has nothing to do with the present narrative,
which begins with the actual arrival of Mr. and
Mrs. Penfound before the portal of their suburban
residence, No. 7, Munster Gardens, at a
quarter before midnight on the 30th of August.</p>

<p>It was a detached house with a spacious triangular
garden at the back; it had an air of comfort,
of sobriety, of good form, of success; one divined
by looking at it that the rent ran to about &pound;80,
and that the tenant was not a man who had to save
up for quarter days. It was a credit to the street,
which upon the whole, with its noble trees and its
pretty curve, is distinctly the best street in Fulham.
And, in fact, No. 7 in every way justified
the innocent pride of the Penfounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can feel cobwebs all over me,&#8221; said Mrs.
Penfound, crossly, as they entered the porch and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
Mr. Penfound took out his latchkey. She was
hungry, hot, and tired, and she exhibited a certain
pettishness&mdash;a pettishness which Mr. Penfound,
whenever it occurred, found a particular
pleasure in soothing. Mr. Penfound himself was
seldom ruffled.</p>

<p>Most men would have been preoccupied with
the discomforts of the arrival, but not George
Penfound. Mr. Penfound was not, and had never
been, of those who go daily into the city by a particular
train, and think the world is coming to an
end if the newsagent fails to put the newspaper
on the doorstep before 8 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. Penfound had lived. He had lived adventurously
and he had lived everywhere. He
had slept under the stars and over the throbbing
screws of ocean steamers. He knew the harbours
of the British Empire, and the waste places of the
unpeopled West, and the mysterious environs of
foreign cities. He had been first mate of a tramp
steamer, wood sawyer in Ontario, ganger on the
Canadian Pacific Railway, clerk at a Rand mine,
and land agent in California.</p>

<p>It was the last occupation that had happened
to yield the eighty thousand dollars which rendered
him independent and established him so
splendidly, at the age of forty, in Fulham, the place
of his birth. Thin, shrewd, clear, and kindly,
his face was the face of a man who has learnt the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
true philosophy of life. He took the world as he
found it, and he found it good.</p>

<p>To such a man an unexpected journey, even
though it ended at a deserted and unprepared
home, whose larder proved as empty as his
stomach, was really nothing.</p>

<p>By the time Mr. Penfound had locked up the
house, turned out the light in the hall, and arrived
in the bedroom, Mrs. Penfound was fast asleep.
He sat down in the armchair by the window,
charmed by the gentle radiance of the night, and
unwilling to go to bed. Like most men who
have seen the world, he had developed the instincts
of a poet, and was something of a dreamer.
Half an hour&mdash;or it might have been an hour:
poets are oblivious of time&mdash;had passed, when
into Mr. Penfound&#8217;s visions there entered a sinister
element. He straightened himself stiffly in
the chair and listened, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;I do believe
it&#8217;s a burglar. I&#8217;ll give the beggar time to get
fairly in, and then we&#8217;ll have some fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he heard a few
clicking noises at the back of the house, and
then a sound as if something was being shoved
hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dining-room window,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>In a few minutes it became perfectly evident
to his trained and acute ear that a burglar occupied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
the dining-room, and accordingly he proceeded
to carry out other arrangements.</p>

<p>Removing his boots, he assumed a pair of soft,
woollen house slippers which lay under the bed.
Then he went to a chest of drawers, and took
out two revolvers. Handling these lovingly, he
glanced once at his sleeping wife, and, shod in
the silent woollen, passed noiselessly out of the
room. By stepping very close to the wall, so as
to put as slight a strain as possible upon the woodwork,
he contrived to descend to the half-landing
without causing a sound, but on the half-landing
itself there occurred an awful creak&mdash;a creak that
seemed to reverberate into infinite space. Mr.
Penfound stopped a second, but, perceiving the
unwisdom of a halt, immediately proceeded.</p>

<p>In that second of consternation he had remembered
that only two chambers of one revolver
and one chamber of the other were loaded. It
was an unfortunate mischance. Should he return
and load fully? Preposterous! He remembered
with pride the sensation which he had
caused one night ten years before in a private
shooting-saloon in Paris. Three shots to cripple
one burglar&mdash;for <i>him</i>; it was a positive extravagance
of means. And he continued down the
stairs, cautiously but rapidly feeling his way.</p>

<p>The next occurrence brought him up standing
at the dining-room door, which was open. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
heard voices in the dining-room. There were,
then, two burglars. Three shots for two burglars?
Pooh! Ample! This was what he
heard:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you drink out of this glass, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I. I took a pull out of the bottle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So did I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause. Mr. Penfound discovered
that by putting an eye to the crack at the
hinges he could see the burglars, who had lighted
one gas jet, and were sitting at the table. They
were his first burglars, and they rather shocked
his preconceived notions of the type. They
hadn&#8217;t the look of burglars&mdash;no bluish chins, no
lowering eyes, no corduroy, no knotted red handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>One, the younger, dressed in blue serge, with
linen collar and a soiled pink necktie, might have
been a city clerk of the lower grade; he had light,
bushy hair and a yellow moustache, his eyes were
large and pale blue, his chin weak; altogether
Mr. Penfound decided that had he seen the young
man elsewhere than in that dining-room he would
never have suspected him to be a burglar. The
other was of middle age, neatly dressed in dark
grey, but with a ruffian&#8217;s face, and black hair, cut
extremely close; he wore a soft felt hat at a negligent
poise, and was smoking a cigarette. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
examining the glass out of which Mr. Penfound
had but recently drunk whisky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Jack,&#8221; the man in grey said to
his companion. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t drunk out of this
glass, and I haven&#8217;t; but someone&#8217;s drunk out
of it. It&#8217;s wet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man paled, and with an oath
snatched up the glass to look at it. Mr. Penfound
noticed how suddenly his features writhed into
a complicated expression of cowardice, cunning,
and vice. He no longer doubted that the youth
was an authentic burglar. The older man remained
calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;This house isn&#8217;t so empty as we thought,
my boy. There&#8217;s someone here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, gentlemen, there is,&#8221; remarked Mr.
Penfound, quietly stepping into the room with a
revolver upraised in each hand.</p>

<p>The young man dropped the glass, and, after
rolling along the table, it fell on the floor and
broke, making a marvellous noise in the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m blowed!&#8221; exclaimed the burglar
in grey, and turned to the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stir; put your hands up, and look
slippy&mdash;I mean business,&#8221; said Mr. Penfound
steadily.</p>

<p>The burglar in grey made two hasty steps to
the window. Mr. Penfound&#8217;s revolver spoke&mdash;it
was the one in his left hand, containing two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
shots&mdash;and with a muffled howl the burglar suddenly
halted, cursing with pain and anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hands up, both of you!&#8221; repeated Mr.
Penfound imperturbably.</p>

<p>A few drops of blood appeared on the left
wrist of the older burglar, showing where he
had been hit. With evident pain he raised both
hands to the level of his shoulders; the left hand
clearly was useless; it hung sideways in a peculiar
fashion. The youthful criminal was trembling
like a spray of maidenhair, and had his hands
high up over his head.</p>

<p>Mr. Penfound joyfully reflected that no London
burglar had ever before found himself in
such a ridiculous position as these two, and he
took a genuine, artistic pleasure in the spectacle.</p>

<p>But what to do next.</p>

<p>The youth began to speak with a whine like
that of a beggar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; said Mr. Penfound impressively,
and proceeded with his cogitations, a revolver
firm and steady in each hand. The shot had evidently
not wakened his wife, and to disturb her
now from a refreshing and long-needed sleep in
order to send her for the police would not only be
unchivalrous, it would disclose a lack of resource,
a certain clumsiness of management, in an affair
which Mr. Penfound felt sure he ought to be able
to carry neatly to an effective conclusion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>Besides, if a revolver-shot in the house had
not wakened his wife, what could wake her? He
could not go upstairs to her and leave the burglars
to await his return.</p>

<p>Then an idea occurred to Mr. Penfound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my men,&#8221; he said cheerfully, &#8220;I
think you understand that I am not joking, and
that I can shoot a bit, and that, whatever the laws
of this country, I <i>do</i> shoot.&#8221; He waved the muzzle
of one revolver in the direction of the grey man&#8217;s
injured wrist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, governor,&#8221; the owner of the wrist
pleaded, &#8220;it hurts dreadful. I shall faint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faint, then. I know it hurts.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s face was white with pain, but Mr.
Penfound had seen too many strange sights in
his life to be greatly moved by the sight of a
rascal with a bullet in his anatomy.</p>

<p>&#8220;To proceed. You will stand side by side
and turn round. The young gentleman will open
the window, and you will pass out into the garden.
March! Slower, slower, I say. Halt!&#8221;</p>

<p>The burglars were now outside, while Mr.
Penfound was still within the room. He followed
them, and in doing so stumbled over a black bag
which lay on the floor. Fortunately he recovered
himself instantly. He noticed lying on the top
of the bag a small bunch of skeleton keys, some
putty, and what looked like a thong of raw hide.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
He also observed that three small panes of the
French window had been forced inwards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn to your left, go down the pathway,
and halt when you come to the side gate. And
don&#8217;t hurry, mind you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They obeyed, without speaking even to each
other. Mr. Penfound had no fear of their disobedience.
He was within two yards of their
heels, and he said to himself that his hands were
superbly steady.</p>

<p>It was at this point that Mr. Penfound began
to feel hungry, really hungry. The whisky had
appeased the cravings of his stomach for a short
time, but now its demands were imperious.
Owing to the exigencies of the day&#8217;s journey he
had not had a satisfying meal for thirty hours;
and Mr. Penfound since settling down had developed
a liking for regular meals. However,
there was nothing to be done at present.</p>

<p>He therefore proceeded with and safely accomplished
his plan of driving the burglars before
him into the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;we shall soon be seeing
a policeman, or some late bird who will fetch a
policeman.&#8221; And he drove his curious team up
Munster Park Gardens towards Fulham Road,
that interminable highway, once rural but rural
no longer.</p>

<p>The thoroughfares seemed to be absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
deserted. Mr. Penfound could scarcely believe
that London, even in the dead of night, could be so
lonely. The gas-lamps shone steady in the still,
warm air, and above them the star-studded sky,
with a thin sickle moon, at which, however, beautiful
as it was, Mr. Penfound could not look. His
gaze was fixed on the burglars. As he inspected
their backs he wondered what their thoughts
were.</p>

<p>He felt that in their place he should have been
somewhat amused by the humour of the predicament.
But their backs showed no sign of feeling,
unless it were that of resignation. The older man
had dropped his injured arm, with Mr. Penfound&#8217;s
tacit consent, and it now hung loose by his side.</p>

<p>The procession moved slowly eastward along
Fulham Road, the two burglars first, silent, glum,
and disgusted, and Mr. Penfound with his revolvers
close behind.</p>

<p>Still no policeman, no wayfarer. Mr. Penfound
began to feel a little anxious. And his hunger
was insufferable. This little procession of his
could not move for ever. Something must occur,
and Mr. Penfound said that something must occur
quickly. He looked up at the houses with a swift
glance, but these dark faces of brick, all with closed
eyelids, gave him no sign of encouragement. He
thought of firing his revolver in order to attract
attention, but remembered in time that if he did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
so he would have only one shot left for his burglars,
an insufficient allowance in case of contingencies.</p>

<p>But presently, as the clock of Fulham parish
church struck three, Mr. Penfound beheld an
oasis of waving palms and cool water in this
desert; that is to say, he saw in the distance one
of those coffee-stalls which just before midnight
mysteriously dot themselves about London, only
to disappear again at breakfast time. The burglars
also saw it, and stopped almost involuntarily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get on now,&#8221; said Mr. Penfound gruffly,
&#8220;and stop five paces <i>past</i> the coffee-stall. D&#8217;ye
hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; whined the young burglar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; remarked the old burglar coolly.</p>

<p>As Mr. Penfound approached the coffee-stall,
he observed that it was no ordinary coffee-stall. It
belonged to the aristocracy of coffee-stalls. It was
painted a lovely deep crimson, and on this crimson,
amid flowers and scrolls, had been inscribed the
names of the delicacies within:&mdash;Tea, coffee, cocoa,
rolls, sandwiches, toast, sausages, even bacon and
eggs. Mr. Penfound&#8217;s stomach called aloud within
him at the rumour of these good things.</p>

<p>When the trio arrived, the stallkeeper happened
to be bending over a tea-urn, and he did
not notice the halt of the procession until Mr.
Penfound spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; Mr. Penfound began, holding the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
revolvers about the level of his top waistcoat
button, and with his eyes fixed on the burglars&mdash;&#8220;I
say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tea or coffee?&#8221; asked the stallkeeper
shortly, looking up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither&mdash;that is, at present,&#8221; replied Mr.
Penfound sweetly. &#8220;The fact is, I&#8217;ve got two
burglars here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two <i>what</i>&mdash;where?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Penfound then explained the whole circumstances.
&#8220;And I want you to fetch a couple
of policemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stallkeeper paused a moment. He was a
grim fellow, so Mr. Penfound gathered from the
corner of his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s about the best story as I ever
&#8217;eard,&#8221; the stallkeeper said. &#8220;And you want me
to fetch a policeman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and I hope you&#8217;ll hurry up. I&#8217;m
tired of holding these revolvers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m to leave my stall, am I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stallkeeper placed the first finger of his
left hand upright against his nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I just ain&#8217;t then. What d&#8217;ye take me
for? A bloomin&#8217; owl? Look &#8217;ere, mister: no
kid! Nigh every night some jokers tries to get
me away from my stall, so as they can empty it
and run off. But I ain&#8217;t been in this line nineteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
year for nuthin&#8217;. No, you go and take yer
tale and yer pistols and yer bloomin&#8217; burglars
somewhere else. &#8217;Ear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; said Mr. Penfound, with
dignity. &#8220;Only I&#8217;ll wait here till a policeman
comes, or someone. You will then learn that I
have told you the truth. How soon will a policeman
be along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Might be a &#8217;our, might be more. There
ain&#8217;t likely to be no other people till four-thirty or
thereabouts; that&#8217;s when my trade begins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Penfound was annoyed. His hunger,
exasperated by the exquisite odours of the stall,
increased every second, and the prospect of waiting
an hour, even half an hour, was appalling.</p>

<p>Another idea occurred to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you,&#8221; he said to the stallkeeper, &#8220;kindly
put one of those sausages into my mouth? I
daren&#8217;t loose these revolvers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not till I sees yer money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hunger made Mr. Penfound humble, and he
continued&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come round and take the money
out of my pocket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t leave this &#8217;ere counter.
I know yer dodges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, I will wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady on, governor. You aren&#8217;t the only
chap that&#8217;s hungry.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>Mr. Penfound turned sharply at the voice. It
was the elder burglar who spoke, and the elder
burglar had faced him and was approaching the
stall, regardless of revolvers. Mr. Penfound
noticed a twinkle in the man&#8217;s eye, a faint appreciation
of the fact that the situation was funny,
and Mr. Penfound gave way to a slight smile. He
was being disobeyed flatly, but for the life of him
he could not shoot. Besides, there was no occasion
to shoot, as the burglar was certainly making no
attempt to escape. The fellow was brave enough,
after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two slabs and a pint o&#8217; thick,&#8221; he said to
the stallkeeper, and was immediately served with
a jug of coffee and two huge pieces of bread-and-butter,
for which he flung down twopence.</p>

<p>Mr. Penfound was astounded&mdash;he was too
astounded to speak&mdash;by the coolness of this
criminal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; the elder burglar continued,
quietly handing one of the pieces of bread-and-butter
to his companion in sin, who by this time
had also crept up, &#8220;you can put down them revolvers
and tuck in till the peeler comes along.
We know when we&#8217;re copped, and we aren&#8217;t
going to skip. You tuck in, governor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it a name,&#8221; said the stallkeeper, with
an eye to business.</p>

<p>Mr. Penfound, scarcely knowing what he did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
or why he did it, put down one revolver and then
the other, fished a shilling from his pocket, and
presently was engaged in the consumption of a
ham sandwich and coffee.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a cool one,&#8221; he said at length, rather
admiringly, to the elder burglar.</p>

<p>&#8220;So are you,&#8221; said the elder burglar; and he
and Mr. Penfound both glanced somewhat scornfully
at the other burglar, undersized, cringing,
pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever been caught before?&#8221; asked Mr. Penfound
pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that got to do with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The retort was gruff, final&mdash;a snub, and Mr.
Penfound felt it as such. He had the curious
sensation that he was in the presence of a superior
spirit, a stronger personality than his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a policeman,&#8221; remarked the stallkeeper
casually, and they all listened, and heard
the noise of regular footfalls away round a distant
corner.</p>

<p>Mr. Penfound struggled inwardly with a sudden
overmastering impulse, and then yielded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go,&#8221; he said quietly to the elder
burglar, &#8220;so clear off before the policeman sees
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Straight?&#8221; the man said, looking him in
the eyes to make sure there was no joking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Straight, my friend.... Here, shake.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>So it happened that Mr. Penfound and the
elder burglar shook hands. The next instant
Mr. Penfound was alone with the stallkeeper;
the other two, with the celerity born of practice,
had vanished into the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever see such a man?&#8221; said Mr.
Penfound to the stallkeeper, putting the revolvers
in his pocket, and feeling strangely happy, as one
who has done a good action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer don&#8217;t kid me,&#8221; was the curt reply. &#8220;It
was all a plant. Want anythink else? Because
if not, ye&#8217;d best go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; said Mr. Penfound, for he had
thought of his wife. He spent sevenpence in
various good things, and was just gathering his
purchases together when the policeman appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night, officer,&#8221; he called out blithely,
and set off to run home, as though for his life.</p>

<p>As he re-entered the bedroom at No. 7 his
wife sat up in bed, a beautiful but accusing figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;George,&#8221; she said, &#8220;where have you been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My love,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been out into
the night to get you this sausage, and this cake,
and this sandwich. Eat them. They will do you
good.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MIDNIGHT AT THE GRAND BABYLON.</h2>
</div>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">WELL, said the doctor, you say I&#8217;ve been very
secretive lately. Perhaps I have. However,
I don&#8217;t mind telling you&mdash;just you fellows&mdash;the
whole history of the affair that has preoccupied me.
I shan&#8217;t assert that it&#8217;s the most curious case in all
my experience. My experience has been pretty
varied, and pretty lively, as you know, and cases
are curious in such different ways. Still, a poisoning
business is always a bit curious, and this one
was extremely so. It isn&#8217;t often that a person who
means to commit murder by poison calls in a physician
to assist him and deliberately uses the unconscious
medico as his tool. Yet that is exactly what
happened. It isn&#8217;t often that a poisoner contrives
to hit on a poison which is at once original, almost
untraceable, and to be obtained from any chemist
without a doctor&#8217;s prescription. Yet that, too, is
exactly what happened. I can assure you that
the entire episode was a lesson to me. It opened
my eyes to the possibilities which lie ready to the
hand of a really intelligent murderer in this twentieth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
century. People talk about the masterpieces
of poisoning in the middle ages. Pooh! Second-rate!
They didn&#8217;t know enough in the middle
ages to achieve anything which a modern poisoner
with genius would deem first-rate; they simply
didn&#8217;t know enough. Another point in the matter
which forcibly struck me was the singular usefulness
of a big London hotel to a talented criminal.
You can do precisely what you please in a big
hotel, and nobody takes the least notice. You
wander in, you wander out, and who cares? You
are only an item in a crowd. And when you have
reached the upper corridors you are as lost to pursuit
and observation as a needle in a haystack.
You may take two rooms, one after the other, in
different names, and in different parts of the hotel;
the servants and officials will be none the wiser,
because the second floor knows not the third, nor
the third the fourth; you may oscillate between
those two rooms in a manner to puzzle Inspector
Anderson himself. And you are just as secure in
your apartments as a medi&aelig;val baron in his castle&mdash;yes,
and more! On that night there were over a
thousand guests in the Grand Babylon Hotel (there
was a ball in the Gold Rooms, and a couple of banquets);
and in the midst of all that diverse humanity,
unperceived, unsuspected, a poignant and
terrible drama was going on, and things so occurred
that I tumbled right into it. Well, I&#8217;ll tell you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>I was called in to the Grand Babylon about nine
p.m.; suite No. 63, second floor, name of Russell.
The outer door of the suite was opened for me by
a well-dressed woman of thirty or so, slim, with
a face expressive and intelligent rather than handsome.
I liked her face&mdash;I was attracted by its
look of honesty and alert good-nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, doctor,&#8221; she said. She had a
charming low voice, as she led me into a highly-luxurious
drawing-room. &#8220;My name is Russell,
and I wish you to see a young friend of mine
who is not well.&#8221; She hesitated and turned to
an old bald-headed man, who stood looking out
of the window at the twilight panorama of the
Thames. &#8220;My friend&#8217;s solicitor, Mr. Dancer,&#8221;
she explained. We bowed, Mr. Dancer and I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing serious, I hope,&#8221; I remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; said Miss Russell.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she seemed to me to be extremely
nervous and anxious, as she preceded
me into the bedroom, a chamber quite as magnificent
as the drawing-room.</p>

<p>On the bed lay a beautiful young girl. Yes,
you may laugh, you fellows, but she was genuinely
beautiful. She smiled faintly as we entered.
Her features had an ashy tint, and tiny drops of
cold perspiration stood on the forehead. However,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
she certainly wasn&#8217;t very ill&mdash;I could see
that in a moment, and I fixed my conversational
tone accordingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you feel as if you could breathe freely,
but that if you did it would kill you?&#8221; I inquired,
after I had examined her. And she nodded,
smiling again. Miss Russell also smiled, evidently
pleased that I had diagnosed the case so
quickly.</p>

<p>My patient was suffering from a mild attack
of pseudo-angina, nothing worse. Not angina
pectoris, you know&mdash;that&#8217;s usually associated with
old age. Pseudo-angina is a different thing. With
a weak heart, it may be caused by indigestion.
The symptoms are cardiac spasms, acute pain in
the chest, a strong disinclination to make even
the smallest movement, and a state of mental depression,
together with that queer fancy about
breathing. The girl had these symptoms, and
she also had a headache and a dicrotism of the
pulse&mdash;two pulsations instead of one, not unusual.
I found that she had been eating a too
hearty dinner, and that she had suffered from
several similar attacks in the immediate past.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had a doctor in before?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Miss Russell. &#8220;But he was unable
to come to-night, and as your house is so
near we sent for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no danger whatever&mdash;no real cause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
for anxiety,&#8221; I summed up. &#8220;I will have some
medicine made up instantly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trinitrin?&#8221; demanded Miss Russell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered, a little astonished at this
readiness. &#8220;Your regular physician prescribed
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>(I should explain to you that trinitrin is nothing
but nitro-glycerine in a non-explosive form.)</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it was trinitrin,&#8221; Miss Russell replied,
with an appearance of doubtfulness. &#8220;Perhaps
you will write the prescription and I will despatch
a messenger at once. I should be obliged, doctor,
if you would remain with us until&mdash;if you would
remain with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Decidedly!&#8221; I said. &#8220;I will remain with
pleasure. But do accept my assurance,&#8221; I added,
gazing at her face, so anxious and apprehensive,
&#8220;that there is no cause for alarm.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled and concurred. But I could see
that I had not convinced her. And I began to
suspect that she was not after all so intelligent as
I had imagined. My patient, who was not now in
any pain, lay calmly, with closed eyes.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Do not forget the old bald-headed lawyer in the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you are often summoned to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
Grand Babylon, sir, living, as you do, just round
the corner,&#8221; he remarked to me somewhat pompously.
He had a big nose and a habit of staring
at you over his eye-glasses with his mouth wide-open,
after having spoken. We were alone together
in the drawing-room. I was waiting for
the arrival of the medicine, and he was waiting
for&mdash;I didn&#8217;t know what he was waiting for.</p>

<p>&#8220;Occasionally. Not often,&#8221; I responded. &#8220;I
am called more frequently to the Majestic, over
the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, just so, just so,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>I could see that he meant to be polite in his
high and dry antique legal style; and I could see
also that he was very bored in that hotel drawing-room.
So I proceeded to explain the case to
him, and to question him discreetly about my
patient and Miss Russell.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are, of course, aware, sir, that the young
lady is Miss Spanton, Miss Adelaide Spanton?&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Not &#8216;the&#8217; Spanton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely, sir. The daughter of Edgar Spanton,
my late client, the great newspaper proprietor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this Miss Russell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Russell was formerly Miss Adelaide&#8217;s
governess. She is now her friend, and profoundly
attached to the young lady; a disinterested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
attachment, so far as I can judge, though
naturally many people will think otherwise. Miss
Adelaide is of a very shy and retiring disposition;
she has no other friends, and she has no near
relatives. Save for Miss Russell she is, sir, if
I may so phrase it, alone in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Miss Spanton is surely very wealthy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You come to the point, sir. If my young
client reaches her twenty-first birthday she will
be the absolute mistress of the whole of her
father&#8217;s fortune. You may have noticed in the
public press that I swore his estate at more than
three millions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how far is Miss Spanton from her
twenty-first birthday?&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>The old lawyer glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something less than three hours. At midnight
she will have legally entered on her 22nd
year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Now I can understand Miss
Russell&#8217;s anxiety, which refuses to be relieved
even by my positive assurance. No doubt Miss
Russell has worked herself up into a highly nervous
condition. And may I inquire what will
happen&mdash;I mean, what would have happened, if
Miss Spanton had not reached her majority?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The entire estate would have passed to a
cousin, a Mr. Samuel Grist, of Melbourne. I
daresay you know the name. Mr. Grist is understood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
to be the leading theatrical manager in
Australia. Speaking as one professional man to
another, sir, I may venture to remark that Mr.
Grist&#8217;s reputation is more than a little doubtful&mdash;you
may have heard&mdash;many transactions and
adventures. Ha, ha! Still, he is my late client&#8217;s
sole surviving relative, except Miss Adelaide. I
have never had the pleasure of meeting him; he
confines himself exclusively to Australia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This night then,&#8221; I laughed, &#8220;will see the
end of any hopes which Mr. Grist may have entertained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, sir,&#8221; the lawyer agreed. &#8220;It will
also see the end of Miss Russell&#8217;s immediate
anxieties. Upon my word, since Mr. Spanton&#8217;s
regrettable death, she has been both father and
mother to my lonely young client. A practical
woman, sir, Miss Russell! And the excessiveness
of her apprehensions, if I may so phrase it,
must be excused. She has begged me to remain
here till midnight, in order that I may witness to
Miss Spanton&#8217;s&mdash;er&mdash;vitality, and also in order
to obtain Miss Spanton&#8217;s signature to certain
necessary documents. I should not be surprised,
sir, if she requested you also to remain. She is
not a woman to omit precautions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t stop till twelve,&#8221; I said.
The conversation ceased, and I fell into meditation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>I do not mind admitting that I was deeply
impressed by what I will call the romantic quality
of the situation. I thought of old Spanton, who
had begun with something less than nothing and
died virtually the owner of three daily papers and
twenty-five weeklies and monthlies. I thought
of Spantons, Ltd., and their colossal offices
spreading half round Salisbury Square. Why,
I even had a copy of the extra special edition
of the <i>Evening Gazette</i> in my pocket! Do
any of you fellows remember Spanton starting
the <i>Evening Gazette</i>? He sold three hundred
thousand the first day. And now old Spanton
was dead&mdash;you know he died of drink, and there
was nothing left of the Spanton blood except
this girl lying there on the bed, and the man in
Australia. And all the Spanton editors, and the
Spanton sub-editors, and the Spanton artists, and
the Spanton reporters and compositors, and the
Spanton rotary presses, and the Spanton paper
mills, and the Spanton cyclists, were slaving and
toiling to put eighty thousand a year into this
girl&#8217;s purse. And there she was, feeble and depressed,
and solitary, except for Miss Russell, and
the man in Australia perhaps hoping she would
die; and there was Miss Russell, worrying and
fussing and apprehending and fearing. And the
entire hotel oblivious of the romantic, I could
almost say the pathetic, situation. And then I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
thought of Miss Spanton&#8217;s future, burdened with
those three millions, and I wondered if those
three millions would buy her happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is the medicine, doctor,&#8221; said Miss
Russell, entering the drawing-room hurriedly, and
handing me the bottle with the chemist&#8217;s label on
it. I went with her into the bedroom. The
beautiful Adelaide Spanton was already better,
and she admitted as much when I administered
the medicine&mdash;two minims of a one per cent. solution
of trinitrin, otherwise nitro-glycerine, the
usual remedy for pseudo-angina.</p>

<p>Miss Russell took the bottle from my hand,
corked it and placed it on the dressing-table.
Shortly afterwards I left the hotel. The lawyer
had been right in supposing that Miss Russell
would ask me to stay, but I was unable to do so.
I promised, however, to return in an hour, all the
while insisting that there was not the slightest danger
for the patient.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>It was 10.30 when I came back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Second floor!&#8221; I said carelessly to the lift
boy, and he whirled me upwards; the Grand
Babylon lifts travel very fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are, sir,&#8221; he murmured respectfully,
and I stepped out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the second floor?&#8221; I asked suddenly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>&#8220;Beg pardon! I thought you said seventh, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time you were in bed, my lad!&#8221; was my
retort, and I was just re-entering the lift when
I caught sight of Miss Russell in the corridor. I
called to her, thinking she would perhaps descend
with me, but she did not hear, and so I followed
her down the corridor, wondering what was her
business on the seventh floor. She opened a
door and disappeared into a room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; I heard a sinister voice exclaim
within the room, and then the door was pushed
to; it was not latched.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did say the seventh!&#8221; I called to the lift-boy,
and he vanished with his machine.</p>

<p>The voice within the room startled me. It
gave me furiously to think, as the French say.
With a sort of instinctive unpremeditated action I
pressed gently against the door till it stood ajar
about an inch. And I listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a confounded mysterious case to me!&#8221;
the voice was saying, &#8220;that that dose the other
day didn&#8217;t finish her. We&#8217;re running it a dashed
sight too close! Here, take this&mdash;it&#8217;s all ready,
label and everything. Substitute the bottles.
I&#8217;ll run no risks this time. One dose will do the
trick inside half an hour, and on that I&#8217;ll bet
my boots!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Miss Russell, quite calmly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s pure trinitrin, is it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re the coolest customer that I ever
struck!&#8221; the voice exclaimed, in an admiring
tone. &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s pure trinitrin&mdash;beautiful, convenient
stuff! Looks like water, no taste, very
little smell, and so volatile that all the doctors on
the Medical Council couldn&#8217;t trace it at a post-mortem.
Besides the doctor prescribed a solution
of trinitrin, and you got it from the chemist,
and in case there&#8217;s a rumpus we can shove the
mistake on to the chemist&#8217;s dispenser, and a fine
old row he&#8217;ll get into. By the way, what&#8217;s the
new doctor like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! So-so!&#8221; said Miss Russell, in her even
tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing on the whole, perhaps, that
I arranged that carriage accident for the first
one!&#8221; the hard, sinister voice remarked. &#8220;One
never knows. Get along now at once, and don&#8217;t
look so anxious. Your face belies your voice.
Give us a kiss!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow!&#8221; said Miss Russell.</p>

<p>I hurried away, as it were drunk, overwhelmed
with horror and amazement, and turning a corner
so as to avoid discovery, reached the second floor
by the staircase. I did not wish to meet Miss
Russell in the lift.</p>

<p>My first thought was not one of alarm for
Adelaide Spanton&mdash;of course, I knew I could
prevent the murder&mdash;but of profound sorrow that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
Miss Russell should have proved to be a woman
so unspeakably wicked. I swore never to trust a
woman&#8217;s face again. I had liked her face. Then
I dwelt on the chance, the mere chance, my careless
pronunciation, a lift-boy&#8217;s error, which had
saved the life of the poor millionaire girl. And
lastly I marvelled at the combined simplicity and
ingenuity of the plot. The scoundrel upstairs&mdash;possibly
Samuel Grist himself&mdash;had taken the
cleverest advantage of Miss Spanton&#8217;s tendency
to pseudo-angina. What could be more clever
than to poison with the physician&#8217;s own medicine?
Very probably the girl&#8217;s present attack had been
induced by an artful appeal to her appetite;
young women afflicted as she was are frequently
just a little greedy. And I perceived that the
villain was correct in assuming that nitro-glycerine
would never be traced at a post-mortem
save in the smallest possible quantity&mdash;just such
a quantity as I had myself prescribed. He was
also right in his assumption that the pure drug
would infallibly kill in half an hour.</p>

<p>I pulled myself together, and having surreptitiously
watched Miss Russell into Suite No. 63,
I followed her. When I arrived at the bedroom
she was pouring medicine from a bottle; a maid
stood at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am just giving the second dose,&#8221; said Miss
Russell easily to me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>&#8220;What a nerve!&#8221; I said to myself, and aloud:
&#8220;By all means.&#8221;</p>

<p>She measured the dose, and approached the
bed without a tremor. Adelaide Spanton opened
her mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; I cried firmly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll delay that
dose for half an hour. Kindly give me the
glass!&#8221; I took the glass from Miss Russell&#8217;s
passive fingers. &#8220;And I would like to have a
word with you now, Miss Russell!&#8221; I added.</p>

<p>The maid went swiftly from the room.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>The old bald-headed lawyer had gone down to
the hotel smoking-saloon for a little diversion,
and we faced each other in the drawing-room&mdash;Miss
Russell and I. The glass was still in my
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the new doctor is so-so, eh?&#8221; I remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you know what I mean,&#8221; I retorted.
&#8220;I need only tell you that by a sheer chance I
stumbled upon your atrocious plot&mdash;the plot of
that scoundrel upstairs. All you had to do was
to exchange the bottles, and administer pure
trinitrin instead of my prescribed solution of it,
and Miss Spanton would be dead in half an hour.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
The three millions would go to the Australian
cousin, and you would doubtless have your reward&mdash;say,
a cool hundred thousand, or perhaps
marriage. And you were about to give the poison
when I stopped you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not!&#8221; she cried. And she fell into a
chair, and hid her face in her hands, and then
looked, as it were longingly, towards the bedroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Spanton is in no danger,&#8221; I said sneeringly.
&#8220;She will be quite well to-morrow. So
you were not going to give the poison, after all?&#8221;
I laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg you to listen, doctor,&#8221; she said at
length, standing up. &#8220;I am in a most invidious
position. Nevertheless, I think I can convince you
that your suspicions against me are unfounded.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed again. But secretly I admired her
for acting the part so well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtless!&#8221; I interjected sarcastically, in
the pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man upstairs is Samuel Grist, supposed
to be in Australia. It is four months ago since
I, who am Adelaide Spanton&#8217;s sole friend, discovered
that he was scheming her death. The
skill of his methods appalled me. There was
nothing to put before the police, and yet I had a
horrible fear of the worst. I felt that he would
stop at nothing&mdash;absolutely at nothing. I felt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
that, if we ran away, he would follow us. I had
a presentiment that he would infallibly succeed,
and I was haunted by it day and night. Then
an idea occurred to me&mdash;I would pretend to be
his accomplice. And I saw suddenly that that
was the surest way&mdash;the sole way, of defeating
him. I approached him and he accepted the
bait. I carried out all his instructions, except
the fatal instructions. It is by his orders, and
for his purposes, that we are staying in this hotel.
Heavens! To make certain of saving my darling
Adelaide, I have even gone through the farce of
promising to marry him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you seriously expect me to believe
this?&#8221; I asked coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Should I have had the solicitor here?&#8221; she
demanded, &#8220;if I had really meant&mdash;meant to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She sobbed momentarily, and then regained
control of herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I said, &#8220;but it occurs to me
that the brain that was capable of deliberately
arranging a murder to take place in the presence
of the doctor might have some hidden purpose
in securing also the presence of the solicitor at the
performance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Grist is unaware that the solicitor is
here. He has been informed that Mr. Dancer
is my uncle, and favourable to the&mdash;to the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
she stopped, apparently overcome.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>&#8220;Oh, indeed!&#8221; I ejaculated, adding: &#8220;And
after all you did not mean to administer this
poison! I suppose you meant to withdraw the
glass at the last instant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not poison,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not poison?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I did not exchange the bottles. I only
pretended to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems to have been a good deal of
pretending,&#8221; I observed. &#8220;By the way, may I
ask why you were giving this stuff, whether it is
poison or not, to my patient? I do not recollect
that I ordered a second dose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the same reason that I pretended to
change the bottle. For the benefit of the maid
whom we saw just now in the bedroom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why for the benefit of the maid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I found out this morning that she
is in the pay of Grist. That discovery accounts
for my nervousness to-night about Adelaide. By
this time the maid has probably told Mr. Grist
what has taken place, and, and&mdash;I shall rely on
your help if anything should happen, doctor.
Surely, surely, you believe me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I regret to say, madam,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;that
I find myself unable to believe you at present.
But there is a simple way of giving credence to
your story. You state that you did not exchange
the bottles. This liquid, then, is the medicine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
prescribed by me, and it is harmless. Oblige
me by drinking it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I held the glass towards her.</p>

<p>She took it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fool!&#8221; I said to myself, as soon as her fingers
had grasped it. &#8220;She will drop it on the
floor, and an invaluable piece of evidence will be
destroyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she did not drop it on the floor. She
drank it at one gulp, and looked me in the eyes,
and murmured, &#8220;Now do you believe me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said. And I did.</p>

<p>At the same moment her face changed colour,
and she sank to the ground. &#8220;What have I
drunk?&#8221; she moaned. The glass rolled on the
carpet, unbroken.</p>

<p>Miss Russell had in fact drunk a full dose of
pure trinitrin. I recognised all the symptoms at
once. I rang for assistance. I got a stomach
pump. I got ice, and sent for ergot and for atropine.
I injected six minims of the Injectis Ergotini
Hypodermica. I despaired of saving her;
but I saved her, after four injections. I need not
describe to you all the details. Let it suffice that
she recovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you did exchange the bottles?&#8221; I
could not help putting this question to her as
soon as she was in a fit state to hear it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear to you that I had not meant to,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
she whispered. &#8220;In my nervousness I must
have confused them. You have saved Adelaide&#8217;s
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have saved yours, anyway,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you believe me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said; and the curious thing is that
I did believe her. I was convinced, and I am
convinced, that she did not mean to exchange the
bottles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; she exclaimed. We could hear
Big Ben striking twelve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Midnight,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>She clutched my hand with a swift movement.
&#8220;Go and see that my Adelaide lives,&#8221;
she cried almost hysterically.</p>

<p>I opened the door between the two rooms and
went into the sleeping chamber.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Spanton is dozing quietly,&#8221; I said, on
my return.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; Miss Russell murmured.
And then old bald-headed Mr. Dancer came into
the room, blandly unconscious of all that had
passed during his sojourn in the smoking saloon.</p>

<p>When I left the precincts of the Grand Babylon
at one o&#8217;clock, the guests were beginning to
leave the Gold Rooms, and the great courtyard
was a scene of flashing lights, and champing
horses, and pretty laughing women.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a queer place a hotel is!&#8221; I thought.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>Neither Mr. Grist nor the mysterious maid
was seen again in London. Possibly they consoled
each other. The beautiful Adelaide Spanton&mdash;under
my care, ahem!&mdash;is completely restored
to health.</p>

<p>Yes, I am going to marry her. No, not the
beautiful Adelaide, you duffers&mdash;besides she is
too young for my middle age&mdash;but Miss Russell.
Her Christian name is Ethel. Do you not like
it? As for the beautiful Adelaide, there is now
a viscount in the case.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE POLICE STATION.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">LORD TRENT has several times remarked to
me that I am a philosopher. And I am
one. I have guided my life by four rules: To
keep my place, to make others keep theirs, to save
half my income, and to beware of women. The
strict observance of these rules has made me (in
my station) a successful and respected man. Once,
and only once, I was lax in my observance, and
that single laxity resulted in a most curious and
annoying adventure, which I will relate.</p>

<p>It was the fourth rule that I transgressed. I
did not beware of a woman. The woman was
Miss Susan Berry, lady&#8217;s maid to the Marchioness
of Cockfosters.</p>

<p>The Cockfosters family is a very old one. To
my mind its traditions are superior to anything in
the peerage of Great Britain; but then I may be
prejudiced. I was brought up in the Cockfosters
household, first at Cockfosters Castle in Devon,
and afterwards at the well-known town house at
the south-east corner of Eaton Square.</p>

<p>My father was valet to the old Marquis for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
thirty years; my mother rose from the position of
fifth housemaid to be housekeeper at the Castle.
Without ever having been definitely assigned to
the situation, I became, as it were by gradual attachment,
valet to Lord Trent&mdash;eldest son of the
Marquis, and as gay and good-natured a gentleman
as ever drank brandy-and-soda before breakfast.</p>

<p>When Lord Trent married Miss Edna Stuyvesant,
the American heiress, and with some of
her money bought and furnished in a superb
manner a mansion near the north-west corner of
Eaton Square, I quite naturally followed him
across the Square, and soon found myself, after
his lordship and my lady, the most considerable
personage at No. 441. Even the butler had to
mind his &#8220;p&#8217;s&#8221; and &#8220;q&#8217;s&#8221; with me.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this pre-eminence of mine which
led to my being selected for a duty which I never
cared for, and which ultimately I asked his lordship
to allow me to relinquish&mdash;of course he did so.
That duty related to the celebrated Cockfosters
emeralds. Lady Trent had money (over a million
sterling, as his lordship himself told me), but
money could not buy the Cockfosters emeralds, and
having seen these she desired nothing less fine.
With her ladyship, to desire was to obtain. I have
always admired her for that trait in her character.
Being an American she had faults, but she knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
her own mind, which is a great thing; and I must
admit that, on the whole, she carried herself well
and committed few blunders. She must have
been accustomed to good servants.</p>

<p>In the matter of the emeralds, I certainly took
her side. Strictly speaking, they belonged to the
old Marchioness, but the Marchioness never went
into society; she was always engaged with temperance
propaganda, militant Protestantism, and
that sort of thing, and consequently never wore
the emeralds. There was no valid reason, therefore,
why Lady Trent should not have the gratification
of wearing them. But the Marchioness, I
say it with respect, was a woman of peculiar and
decided views. She had, in fact, fads; and one
of her fads was the emeralds. She could not
bear to part with them. She said she was afraid
something might happen to the precious heirlooms.</p>

<p>A prolonged war ensued between the Marchioness
and my lady, and ultimately a compromise
was effected. My lady won permission to
wear the emeralds whenever she chose, but they
were always to be brought to her and taken back
again by Susan Berry, in whom the Marchioness
had more confidence than in anyone else in the
world. Consequently, whenever my lady required
the emeralds, word was sent across the Square in
the afternoon; Susan Berry brought them over,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
and Susan Berry removed them at night when my
lady returned from her ball or reception.</p>

<p>The arrangement was highly inconvenient for
Susan Berry, for sometimes it would be very late
when my lady came home; but the Marchioness
insisted, and since Susan Berry was one of those
persons who seem to take a positive joy in martyrising
themselves, she had none of my pity. The
nuisance was that someone from our house had to
accompany her across the Square. Eaton Square
is very large (probably the largest in London, but
I may be mistaken on such a trivial point); its
main avenue is shut in by trees; and at 2 a.m. it
is distinctly not the place for an unprotected female
in charge of valuable property. Now the Marchioness
had been good enough to suggest that she
would prefer me to escort her maid on this brief
nocturnal journey. I accepted the responsibility,
but I did not hide my dislike for it. Knowing
something of Miss Berry&#8217;s disposition, I knew
that our household would inevitably begin, sooner
or later, to couple our names together, and I was
not deceived.</p>

<p>Such was the situation when one night&mdash;it was
a Whit-Monday, I remember, and about a quarter
past one&mdash;Lord and Lady Trent returned from an
entertainment at a well-known mansion near St.
James&#8217;s Palace. I got his lordship some whisky
in the library, and he then told me that I might go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
to bed, as he should not retire for an hour or so.
I withdrew to the little office off the hall, and
engaged in conversation with the second footman,
who was on duty. Presently his lordship came
down into the hall and began to pace about&mdash;it
was a strange habit of his&mdash;smoking a cigarette.
He caught sight of me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saunders,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I told you you could
go to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your lordship forgets the emeralds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, of course.&#8221; He laughed. I motioned
to the footman to clear out.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to care for that job, Saunders,&#8221;
his lordship resumed, quizzing me. &#8220;Surely
Berry is a charming companion. In your place I
should regard it as excellent fun. But I have
often told you that you have no sense of humour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not all men laugh at the same jokes, my
lord,&#8221; I observed.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, in earlier and wilder days,
his lordship had sometimes thrown a book or a
boot at me for smiling too openly in the wrong
place.</p>

<p>The conversation might have continued further,
for his lordship would often talk with me, but at
that moment Susan Berry appeared with the bag
containing the case in which were the emeralds.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
Lady Trent&#8217;s own maid was with her, and the
two stood talking for an instant at the foot of the
stairs, while Lady Trent&#8217;s maid locked the bag
and handed the key to Berry. Heaven knows how
long that simple business would have occupied
had not the voice of my lady resounded from the
first floor, somewhat excitedly calling for her maid,
who vanished with a hurried good-night. His
lordship had already departed from the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I relieve you of the bag, Miss Berry?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Saunders,&#8221; she replied,
&#8220;but the Marchioness prefers that I myself
should carry it.&#8221;</p>

<p>That little dialogue passed between us every
time the emeralds had to be returned.</p>

<p>We started on our short walk, Miss Berry and
I, proceeding towards the main avenue which runs
through the centre of the Square east and west.
It was a beautiful moonlight night. Talking of
moonlight nights, I may as well make my confession
at once. The fact is that Miss Berry had
indeed a certain influence over me. In her presence
I was always conscious of feeling a pleasurable
elation&mdash;an excitement, a perturbation, which
another man might have guessed to be the beginning
of love.</p>

<p>I, however, knew that it was not love. It was
merely a fancy. It only affected me when I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
in her company. When she was absent I could
regard her in my mind&#8217;s eye as she actually was&mdash;namely,
a somewhat designing young woman,
with dark eyes and too much will of her own.
Nevertheless, she had, as I say, a certain influence
over me, and I have already remarked that it was
a moonlight night.</p>

<p>Need I say more? In spite of what I had
implied to Lord Trent I did enjoy the walk with
Susan Berry. Susan Berry took care that I should.
She laid herself out to fascinate me; turning her
brunette face up to mine with an air of deference,
and flashing upon me the glance of those dark
lustrous eyes.</p>

<p>She started by sympathising with me in the
matter of the butler. This was, I now recognise,
very clever of her, for the butler has always been
a sore point with me. I began to think (be good
enough to remember the moonlight and the trees)
that life with Susan Berry might have its advantages.</p>

<p>Then she turned to the topic of her invalid
sister, Jane Mary, who was lame and lived in
lodgings near Sloane Street, and kept herself, with
a little aid from Susan, by manufacturing artificial
flowers. For a month past Miss Berry had referred
regularly to this sister, who appeared to be the
apple of her eye. I had no objection to the topic,
though it did not specially interest me; but on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
the previous evening Miss Berry had told me, with
a peculiar emphasis, that her poor dear sister often
expressed a longing to see the famous Cockfosters
emeralds, and that she resided quite close too. I
did not like that.</p>

<p>To-night Miss Berry made a proposition which
alarmed me. &#8220;Mr. Saunders,&#8221; she said insinuatingly,
&#8220;you are so good-natured that I have
almost a mind to ask you a favour. Would you
object to walking round with me to my sister&#8217;s&mdash;it
is only a few minutes away&mdash;so that I could just
give her a peep at these emeralds. She is dying
to see them, and I&#8217;m sure the Marchioness wouldn&#8217;t
object. We should not be a quarter of an hour
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>My discretion was aroused. I ought to have
given a decided negative at once; but somehow I
couldn&#8217;t, while Susan was looking at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely your sister will be in bed,&#8221; I
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; with a sigh. &#8220;She has to work
very late&mdash;very late indeed. And besides, if she
is, I could take them up to her room. It would
do her good to see them, and she has few
pleasures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Marchioness might not like it,&#8221; I said,
driven back to the second line of fortification.
&#8220;You know your mistress is very particular about
these emeralds.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>&#8220;The Marchioness need never know,&#8221; Susan
Berry whispered, putting her face close up to mine.
&#8220;No one need know, except just us two.&#8221;</p>

<p>The accent which she put on those three words
&#8220;just us two,&#8221; was extremely tender.</p>

<p>I hesitated. We were already at the end of
the Square, and should have turned down to the
left towards Cockfosters House.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along,&#8221; she entreated, placing her
hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I muttered, but I
went along with her towards Sloane Street. We
passed Eaton Place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Miss Berry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I began again, collecting
my courage.</p>

<p>Then there was a step behind us, and another
hand was placed on my shoulder. I turned round
sharply. It was a policeman. His buttons shone
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name is Charles Saunders,&#8221; he said to
me; &#8220;and yours Susan Berry,&#8221; to my companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; I replied, for both of us.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a warrant for your arrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our arrest!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, on a charge of attempting to steal some
emeralds, the property of the Marquis of Cockfosters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he sneered, &#8220;that&#8217;s what they all say.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>&#8220;But the emeralds are here in this bag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know they are,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just
copped you in time. But you&#8217;ve been suspected
for days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing is ridiculous,&#8221; I said, striving to
keep calm. &#8220;We are taking the emeralds back
to Lady Cockfosters, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I stopped. If we were merely taking
the emeralds back to Lady Cockfosters, that is,
from one house in Eaton Square to another house
in Eaton Square, what were we doing out of the
Square?</p>

<p>I glanced at Susan Berry. She was as white as
a sheet. The solution of the puzzle occurred to
me at once. Susan&#8217;s sister was an ingenious fiction.
Susan was a jewel thief, working with a gang of
jewel thieves, and her request that I would accompany
her to this mythical sister was part of a plan
for stealing the emeralds.</p>

<p>&#8220;At whose instance has the warrant been issued?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Marquis of Cockfosters.&#8221;</p>

<p>My suspicions were only too well confirmed.</p>

<p>I did not speak a word to Susan Berry. I
could not. I merely looked at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll come quietly to the station?&#8221; the
policeman said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;As for us, the
matter can soon be cleared up. I am Lord<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
Trent&#8217;s valet, No. 441, Eaton Square, and he
must be sent for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, must he!&#8221; the constable jeered. &#8220;Come
on. Perhaps you&#8217;d prefer a cab.&#8221;</p>

<p>A four-wheeler was passing. I myself hailed
the sleepy cabman, and we all three got in. The
policeman prudently took the bag from Susan&#8217;s
nerveless hands. None of us spoke. I was too
depressed, Susan was probably too ashamed, and
the constable was no doubt too bored.</p>

<p>After a brief drive we drew up. Another
policeman opened the door of the cab, and over
the open portal of the building in front of us I
saw the familiar blue lamp, with the legend &#8220;Metropolitan
Police&#8221; in white letters. The two
policemen carefully watched us as we alighted,
and escorted us up the steps into the station.
Happily, there was no one about; my humiliation
was abject enough without that.</p>

<p>Charles Saunders a prisoner in a police
station! I could scarcely credit my senses. One
becomes used to a police station&mdash;in the newspapers;
but to be inside one&mdash;that is different,
widely different.</p>

<p>The two policemen took us into a bare room,
innocent of any furniture save a wooden form, a
desk, a chair, some printed notices of rewards
offered, and an array of handcuffs and revolvers
on the mantelpiece. In the chair, with a big book<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
in front of him on the desk, sat the inspector in
charge. He was in his shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>&#8220;A hot night,&#8221; he said, smiling, to the policeman.</p>

<p>I silently agreed.</p>

<p>It appeared that we were expected.</p>

<p>They took our full names, our addresses and
occupations, and then the inspector read the warrant
to us. Of course, it didn&#8217;t explain things in
the least. I began to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me warn you,&#8221; said the inspector, &#8220;that
anything you say now may be used against you at
your trial.&#8221;</p>

<p>My trial!</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I write a note to Lord Trent?&#8221; I asked,
nettled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you will pay for a cab to take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I threw down half-a-crown, and scribbled a
line to my master, begging him to come at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;The constable must search you,&#8221; the inspector
said, when this was done and the first
policeman had disappeared with the note.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will save him the trouble,&#8221; I said proudly,
and I emptied my pockets of a gold watch and
chain, a handkerchief, two sovereigns, a sixpence,
two halfpennies, a bunch of keys, my master&#8217;s
linen book, and a new necktie which I had bought
that very evening; of which articles the inspector
made an inventory.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>&#8220;Which is the key of the bag?&#8221; asked the
inspector. The bag was on the desk in front of
him, and he had been trying to open it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing of that,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you, Susan Berry, give up the key,&#8221;
the inspector said, sternly, turning to her.</p>

<p>For answer Susan burst into sobs, and flung
herself against my breast. The situation was excessively
embarrassing for me. Heaven knows I
had sufficient reason to hate the woman, but
though a thief, she was in distress, and I must
own that I felt for her.</p>

<p>The constable stepped towards Susan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; I said, &#8220;you have a female
searcher?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A female searcher! Ah, yes!&#8221; smiled the
inspector, suddenly suave. &#8220;Is she here, constable?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, sir; she&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That must wait, then. Take them to the
cells.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, sir, all the cells are full. Bank Holiday
drunks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The inspector thought a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lock &#8217;em up in the back room,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;That&#8217;ll do for the present. Perhaps the male
prisoner may be getting an answer to his note
soon. After that they&#8217;ll have to go to Vine Street
or Marlborough.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>The constable touched his helmet, and marched
us out. In another moment we were ensconced
in a small room, absolutely bare of any furniture,
except a short wooden form. The constable was
locking the door when Susan Berry screamed out:
&#8220;You aren&#8217;t going to lock us up here together in
the dark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what do you want? Didn&#8217;t you hear
the cells are full?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was profoundly thankful they were full. I
did not fancy a night in a cell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want a candle,&#8221; she said, fiercely.</p>

<p>He brought one, or rather half of one, stuck in
a bottle, and placed it on the mantelpiece. Then
he left us.</p>

<p>Again I say the situation was excessively embarrassing.
For myself, I said nothing. Susan
Berry dropped on the form, and hiding her face
in her hands, gave way to tears without any
manner of restraint. I pitied her a little, but
that influence which previously she had exercised
over me was gone. &#8220;Oh, Mr. Saunders,&#8221; she
sobbed, &#8220;what shall we do?&#8221; And as she spoke
she suddenly looked up at me with a glance of
feminine appeal. I withstood it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Berry,&#8221; I said severely, &#8220;I wonder that
you can look me in the face. I trusted you as a
woman, and you have outraged that trust. I never
dreamed that you were&mdash;that you were an adventuress.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
It was certainly a clever plot, and but for
the smartness of the police I should, in my innocence,
have fallen a victim to your designs. For
myself, I am grateful to the police. I can understand
and excuse their mistake in regarding me as
your accomplice. That will soon be set right, for
Lord Trent will be here. In the meantime, of
course, I have been put to considerable humiliation.
Nevertheless, even this is better than having
followed you to your &#8216;sister&#8217;s.&#8217; In your
&#8216;sister&#8217;s&#8217; lodging I might have been knocked
senseless, or even murdered. Moreover, the
emeralds are safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put on an innocent expression, playing
the injured maiden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Saunders, you surely do not imagine&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Berry, no protestations, I beg. Let
me say now that I have always detected in your
character something underhand, something crafty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t trouble,&#8221; I interrupted her icily, &#8220;for
I shall not believe you. This night will certainly
be a warning to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that I leaned my back against the mantelpiece,
and abandoned myself to gloomy thought.
It was a moment for me of self-abasement. I
searched my heart, and I sorrowfully admitted
that my predicament was primarily due to disobeying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
that golden rule&mdash;beware of women. I
saw now that it was only my absurd fancy for
this wicked creature which had led me to accept
the office of guarding those emeralds during their
night-passage across Eaton Square. I ought to
have refused in the first place, for the job was
entirely outside my functions; strictly, the butler
should have done it.</p>

<p>And this woman in front of me&mdash;this Susan
Berry, in whom the old Marchioness had such
unbounded trust! So she belonged to the con-fraternity
of jewel thieves&mdash;a genus of which I
had often read, but which I had never before met
with. What audacity such people must need in
order to execute their schemes!</p>

<p>But then the game was high. The Cockfosters
emeralds were worth, at a moderate estimate,
twelve thousand pounds. There are emeralds
and emeralds, the value depends on the colour;
these were the finest Colombian stones, of a marvellous
tint, and many of them were absolutely
without a flaw. There were five stones of seven
carats each, and these alone must have been worth
at least six thousand pounds. Yes, it would have
been a great haul, a colossal haul.</p>

<p>Time passed, the candle was burning low, and
there was no sign of Lord Trent. I went to the
door and knocked, first gently, then more loudly,
but I could get no answer. Then I walked about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
the room, keeping an eye on Susan Berry, who
had, I freely admit, the decency to avoid my gaze.
I was beginning to get extremely tired. I wished
to sit down, but there was only one form; Susan
Berry was already upon it, and, as I said before,
it was a very short form. At last I could hold out
no longer. Taking my courage in both hands, I
sat down boldly at one end of the form. It was a
relief to me. Miss Berry sighed. There were not
six inches between us.</p>

<p>The candle was low in the socket, we both
watched it. Without a second&#8217;s warning the flame
leapt up and then expired. We were in the dark.
Miss Berry screamed, and afterwards I heard her
crying. I myself made no sign. Fortunately the
dawn broke almost immediately.</p>

<p>By this time I was getting seriously annoyed
with Lord Trent. I had served him faithfully, and
yet at the moment of my genuine need he had not
come to my succour. I went again to the door
and knocked with my knuckles. No answer. Then
I kicked it. No answer. Then I seized the handle
and violently shook it. To my astonishment the
door opened. The policeman had forgotten to
lock it.</p>

<p>I crept out into the passage, softly closing the
door behind me. It was now quite light. The
door leading to the street was open, and I could
see neither constables nor inspector. I went into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
the charge room; it was empty. Then I proceeded
into the street. On the pavement a piece
of paper was lying. I picked it up; it was the
note which I had written to Lord Trent.</p>

<p>A workman happened to be loitering along a
road which crossed this street at right angles. I
called out and ran to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;why all the
officers have left the police station?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look &#8217;ere, matey,&#8221; he says, &#8220;you get on
&#8217;ome; you&#8217;ve been making a night of it, that&#8217;s
wot you &#8217;ave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, seriously,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>Then I saw a policeman at a distant corner.
The workman whistled, and the policeman was
obliging enough to come to us.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ere&#8217;s a cove wants to know why all the police
&#8217;as left the police station,&#8221; the workman said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What police station?&#8221; the constable said
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, this one down here in this side-street,&#8221;
I said, pointing to the building. As I looked at it
I saw that the lamp which I had observed on the
previous night no longer hung over the doorway.</p>

<p>The constable laughed good-humouredly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get away home,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>I began to tell him my story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get away home,&#8221; he repeated&mdash;gruffly this
time, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll run you in.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>&#8220;All right,&#8221; I said huffily, and I made as if
to walk down the other road. The constable and
the workman grinned to each other and departed.
As soon as they were out of sight, I returned to
my police station.</p>

<p>It was not a police station! It was merely a
rather large and plain-fronted empty house, which
had been transformed into a police station, for
one night only, by means of a lamp, a desk, two
forms, a few handcuffs, and some unparalleled
cheek. Jewel thieves they were, but Susan Berry
was not among them. After all Susan Berry probably
had an invalid sister named Jane Mary.</p>

<p>The first policeman, the cabman, the second
policeman, the inspector&mdash;these were the jewel
thieves, and Susan Berry and I (and of course the
Marchioness) had been the victims of as audacious
and brilliant a robbery as was ever planned.
We had been robbed openly, quietly, deliberately,
with the aid of a sham police station. Our movements
must have been watched for weeks. I
gave my meed of admiration to the imagination,
the skill, and the <i>sangfroid</i> which must have gone
to the carrying out of this coup.</p>

<p>Going back into the room where Susan Berry
and I had spent the night hours, I found that
wronged woman sweetly asleep on the form, with
her back against the wall. I dared not wake her.
And so I left her for the present to enjoy some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
much-needed repose. I directed my steps in
search of Eaton Square, having closed the great
door of my police station.</p>

<p>At length I found my whereabouts, and I arrived
at No. 441 at five o&#8217;clock precisely. The
morning was lovely. After some trouble I roused
a housemaid, who let me in. She seemed surprised,
but I ignored her. I went straight upstairs
and knocked at my master&#8217;s door. To wake
him had always been a difficult matter, and this
morning the task seemed more difficult than ever.
At last he replied sleepily to my summons.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I&mdash;Saunders&mdash;your lordship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to the devil, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see your lordship instantly. Very
seriously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, what? I&#8217;ll come in a minute,&#8221; and I
heard him stirring, and the voice of Lady Trent.</p>

<p>How should I break the news to him? What
would the Marchioness say when she knew?
Twelve thousand pounds&#8217; worth of jewels is no
trifle. Not to mention my gold watch, my two
sovereigns, my sixpence, and my two halfpennies.
And also the half-crown which I had given to
have the message despatched to his lordship. It
was the half-crown that specially rankled.</p>

<p>Lord Trent appeared at the door of his room,
arrayed in his crimson dressing-gown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Saunders, what in the name of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; I stammered, and then I told him
the whole story.</p>

<p>He smiled, he laughed, he roared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay it sounds very funny, my lord,&#8221; I
said, &#8220;but it wasn&#8217;t funny at the time, and Lady
Cockfosters won&#8217;t think it very funny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, won&#8217;t she! She will. No one will
enjoy it more. She might have taken it seriously
if the emeralds had been in the bag, but they
weren&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the bag, my lord!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Lady Trent&#8217;s maid ran off with the
bag, thinking that your mistress had put the jewels
in it. But she had not. Lady Trent came to the
top of the stairs to call her back, as soon as she
found the bag gone, but you and Berry were out
of the house. So the emeralds stayed here for
one night. They are on Lady Trent&#8217;s dressing-table
at the present moment. Go and get a stiff
whisky, Saunders. You need it. And then may
I suggest that you should return for the sleeping
Berry? By the way, the least you can do is to
marry her, Saunders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never, my lord!&#8221; I said with decision. &#8220;I
have meddled sufficiently with women.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIMA
DONNA.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">MANY years ago the fear of dynamite stalked
through the land. An immense organisation
of anarchists whose headquarters were in
the United States had arranged for a number
of simultaneous displays in London, Glasgow,
and Quebec. As is well known now, the Parliament
House at Quebec and the gasworks at Glasgow
were to be blown up, while the programme
for London included Scotland Yard, most of
Whitehall, the House of Commons, the Tower,
and four great railway stations thrown in.</p>

<p>This plot was laid bare, stopped, and made
public, and&mdash;except a number of people who
happened quite innocently to carry black bags&mdash;no
one was put to the slightest inconvenience.</p>

<p>The dynamite scare was deemed to be at an
end. But the dread organisation was in fact still
active, as the sixty policemen who were injured
in what is called the &#8220;Haymarket Massacre&#8221;
explosion at Chicago, on May 4, 1886, have dire
occasion to know.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>Everyone who reads the papers is familiar with
the details of the Haymarket Massacre. Few
people, however, are aware that a far more dastardly
outrage had been planned to intimidate
London a few days later. Through the agency
of a courageous woman this affair too was unmasked
in its turn, but for commercial and other
reasons it was kept from the general public.</p>

<p>The scheme was to blow up the Opera House
at Covent Garden on the first night of the season.
Had the facts got abroad, the audience would
probably have been somewhat sparse on that
occasion; but the facts did not get abroad, and the
house was crowded in every part; for the famous
prima donna Louise Vesea (since retired) was singing
&#8220;Marguerite,&#8221; in &#8220;Faust,&#8221; and enthusiasm
about her was such that though the popular tenor
had unaccountably thrown up his engagement, the
price of stalls rose to thirty-three shillings. The
police were sure of themselves, and the evening
passed off with nothing more explosive than applause.
Nevertheless, that night, after the curtain
had fallen and Louise Vesea had gathered up all
the wreaths and other tributes of admiration which
had been showered upon her, there happened the
singular incident which it is our purpose to record.</p>

<p>Vesea, wrapped in rich furs&mdash;it was midnight,
and our usual wintry May&mdash;was just leaving the
stage door for her carriage, when a gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
respectfully accosted her. He was an English
detective on special service, and Vesea appeared
to know him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be desirable for you to run no risks,
Madame,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So far as we know all the
principals have left the country in alarm, but there
are always others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vesea smiled. She was then over thirty, in
the full flower of her fame and beauty. Tall, dark,
calm, mysterious, she had the firm yet gentle look
of one who keeps a kind heart under the regal
manner induced by universal adoration.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have I to fear?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vengeance,&#8221; the detective answered simply.
&#8220;I have arranged to have you shadowed, in
case&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will do nothing of the kind,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;The idea is intolerable to me. I am not afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective argued, but in vain.</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall be as you wish, Madame,&#8221; he said,
ultimately.</p>

<p>Vesea got into her carriage, and was driven
away. The pair of chestnuts travelled at a brisk
trot through the dark deserted streets of Soho towards
the West End. The carriage had crossed
Regent Street and was just entering Berkeley
Square when a hansom, coming at a gallop along
Struton Street on the wrong side of the road,
collided violently with Vesea&#8217;s horses at the corner.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
At the same moment another carriage, a brougham,
came up and stopped. A gentleman jumped out,
and assisted in disengaging Vesea&#8217;s coachman and
footman from the medley of harness and horse-flesh.
This done, he spoke to Vesea, who, uninjured,
was standing on the footpath.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of your chestnuts will have to be shot,&#8221;
he said, raising his hat. &#8220;May I place my own
carriage at your disposal?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vesea thankfully accepted his offer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upper Brook Street,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;But
you are sure I do not inconvenience you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Curiously enough,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I live in
Upper Brook Street myself, and if I may accompany
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are more than kind,&#8221; she said, and they
both entered the brougham, the gentleman having
first thoughtfully taken the number of the peccant
cabby, and given some valuable advice to Vesea&#8217;s
coachman.</p>

<p>The brougham disappeared at a terrific pace.
But it never went within half a mile of Upper
Brook Street. It turned abruptly to the north,
crossed Oxford Street, and stopped in front of a
large house in a remote street near Paddington
Station. At the same instant the door of the
house opened, and a man ran down to the carriage.
In a moment Vesea, with a cloth wrapped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
round her head, was carried struggling into the
house, and the brougham departed. The thing
was done as quickly and silently as in a dream.</p>

<p>The cloth was removed at length, and Vesea
found herself in a long bare room, furnished only
with chairs and a table. She realised that the
carriage accident was merely part of a plot to capture
her without fuss and violence. She was incapable
of fear, but she was extremely annoyed
and indignant. She looked round for the man
who enticed her into his brougham. He was not
to be seen; his share of the matter was over. Two
other men sat at the table. Vesea stared at them
in speechless anger. As to them, they seemed to
ignore her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the Chief?&#8221; said one to the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will be here in three minutes. We
are to proceed with the examination; time is
short.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the two men turned to Vesea, and the
elder spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be anxious to know why you are
here,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She gazed at him scornfully, and he continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are here because you have betrayed the
anarchist cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not an anarchist,&#8221; she said coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Admitted. But a week ago a member of our
society gave you a warning to keep away from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
Opera House to-night. In so warning you he was
false to his oath&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you refer to Salti, the tenor?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. You perceive we have adherents in
high places. Salti, then, warned you&mdash;and you
instantly told the police. That was your idea of
gratitude. Did Salti love you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I decline to be cross-examined.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is immaterial. We know that he loved
you. Now it is perilous for an anarchist to love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not believe that Salti is one of you,&#8221; she
broke in.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not,&#8221; the man said quietly. &#8220;He is
dead. He was in the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of herself she started, and both men
smiled cynically.</p>

<p>&#8220;The point is this,&#8221; the elder man proceeded.
&#8220;We do not know how much Salti told you. It is
possible that he may have blurted out other and
more important&mdash;er&mdash;schemes than this of the
Opera House which has failed. Have you anything
to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! We expected that. Now, let me point
out that you are dangerous to us, that there is only
one possible course open to you. You must join
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Join you?&#8221; she exclaimed, and then laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the man said. &#8220;I repeat there is no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
alternative&mdash;none whatever. You must take the
oaths.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I refuse?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders, and after a
suggestive pause murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;think of Salti.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do refuse,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>A door opened at the other end of the room,
and a third man entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chief!&#8221; said the younger of the men at
the table. &#8220;He will continue the examination.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new-comer was comparatively youthful&mdash;under
thirty&mdash;and had the look of a well-born
Italian. He gave a glance at Vesea, stood still,
and then approached the table and sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Louise Vesea,&#8221; the first speaker said,
and rapidly indicated how far he had gone. There
was a long silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, brothers,&#8221; the Chief said. &#8220;By a
strange coincidence I know this lady&mdash;this woman,
and I feel convinced that it will be better, in the
interests of our cause, if&mdash;if I examine her alone.&#8221;
He spoke with authority, and yet with a certain
queer hesitation.</p>

<p>The two men silently, but with obvious reluctance,
rose and left the room.</p>

<p>When they were alone, the great singer and the
Chief fronted each other in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Vesea.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; the Chief began slowly and
thoughtfully. &#8220;Do you remember singing in
Milan ten years ago? You were at the beginning
of your career then, but already famous.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice was rich and curiously persuasive.</p>

<p>Without wishing to do so, Vesea nodded an
affirmative.</p>

<p>&#8220;One night you were driving home from the
opera, and there was a riot going on in the streets.
The police were everywhere. People whispered
of a secret revolutionary society among the students
of the University. As for the students, after a
pitched battle near the Cathedral, they were flying.
Suddenly, looking from your carriage, you saw a
very youthful student, who had been struck on the
head, fall down in the gutter and then get up
again and struggle on. You stopped your carriage.
&#8216;Save me,&#8217; the youth cried, &#8216;Save me,
Signorina. If the police catch me I shall get ten
years&#8217; imprisonment!&#8217; You opened the door of
your carriage, and the youth jumped in. &#8216;Quick,
under the rug,&#8217; you said quietly. You did not
ask me any questions. You didn&#8217;t stay to consider
whether the youth might be a dangerous
person. You merely said, &#8216;Quick, under the
rug!&#8217; The youth crept under the rug. The
carriage moved on slowly, and the police, who
shortly appeared, never thought of looking within
it for a fugitive young anarchist. The youth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
was saved. For two days you had him in your
lodging, and then he got safely away to the coast,
and so by ship to another country. Do you remember
that incident, Madame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember it well,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;What
happened to the youth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am he,&#8221; the Chief said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I should scarcely
have guessed but for your voice. You are
changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In our profession one changes quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you remind me of that incident?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You saved my life then. I shall save yours
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is my life really in danger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless you joined us&mdash;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;In London! Impossible!&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a gesture with his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not let us argue on that point,&#8221; he said
gravely. &#8220;Go through that door,&#8221; he pointed to
the door by which he himself had entered. &#8220;You
will find yourself in a small garden. The garden
gate leads to a narrow passage past some stables
and so into the street. Go quickly, and take a cab.
Don&#8217;t return to your own house. Go somewhere
else&mdash;anywhere else. And leave London early
to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>He silently opened the door for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said. His seriousness had
affected her. &#8220;How shall you explain my departure
to your&mdash;your friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In my own way,&#8221; he replied calmly. &#8220;When
a man has deliberately betrayed his cause, there is
only one explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Betrayed his cause!&#8221; She repeated the
phrase wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; he said, &#8220;do you suppose they
will call it anything else? Go at once. I will
wait half an hour before summoning my comrades.
By that time they will have become impatient.
Then you will be safe, and I will give
them my explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that will be&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>He put her right hand to his lip and then
stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Madame,&#8221; he said without replying
to the question. &#8220;We are quits. I kiss your
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost reluctantly Louise Vesea went forth.
And as she reached the street she felt for the first
time that it was indeed a fatal danger from which
she had escaped. She reflected that the Chief
had imposed no secrecy upon her, made no conditions;
and she could not help but admire such
a method of repaying a debt. She wondered
what his explanation to his comrades would be.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>Half an hour later, when Vesea was far away,
there was the sound of a revolver shot. The
other two plotters rushed into the room which
the prima donna had left, and found all the explanation
which the Chief had vouchsafed.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE EPISODE IN ROOM 222.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE date was the fifth of November, a date
easy to remember; not that I could ever
fail to recall it, even without the aid of the associations
which cluster round Guy Fawkes. It was
a Friday&mdash;and yet there are people who affect to
believe that Friday is not a day singled out from
its six companions for mystery, strangeness, and
disaster! The number of the room was 222, as
easy to remember as the date; not that I could
ever fail to recall the number also. Every circumstance
in the affair is fixed in my mind immovably
and for ever. The hotel I shall call by
the name of the Grand Junction Terminus Hotel.
If this tale were not a simple and undecorated
record of fact, I might with impunity choose for
its scene any one of the big London hotels in
order by such a detail to give a semblance of
veracity to my invention; but the story happens
to be absolutely true, and I must therefore, for
obvious reasons, disguise the identity of the place
where it occurred. I would only say that the
Grand Junction Railway is one of the largest and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
one of the best-managed systems in England, or
in the world: and that these qualities of vastness
and of good management extend also to its immense
Terminus Hotel in the North of Central
London. The caravanserai (I have observed that
professional writers invariably refer to a hotel as a
caravanserai) is full every night in the week except
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday; and every
commercial traveller knows that, except on these
nights, if he wishes to secure a room at the Grand
Junction he must write or telegraph for it in
advance. And there are four hundred bedrooms.</p>

<p>It was somewhat late in the evening when I
arrived in London. I had meant to sleep at a
large new hotel in the Strand, but I felt tired, and
I suddenly, on the spur of the moment, decided
to stay at the Grand Junction, if there was space
for me. It is thus that Fate works.</p>

<p>I walked into the hall, followed by a platform
porter with my bag. The place seemed just as
usual, the perfection of the commonplace, the
business-like, and the unspiritual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you a room?&#8221; I asked the young lady
in black, whose yellow hair shone gaily at the
office window under the electric light.</p>

<p>She glanced at her ledgers in the impassive
and detached manner which hotel young ladies
with yellow hair invariably affect, and ejaculated:</p>

<p>&#8220;No. 221.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>&#8220;Pity you couldn&#8217;t make it all twos,&#8221; I ventured,
with timid jocularity. (How could I guess
the import of what I was saying?)</p>

<p>She smiled very slightly, with a distant condescension.
It is astonishing the skill with which
a feminine hotel clerk can make a masculine guest
feel small and self-conscious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Name?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Edge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fourth floor,&#8221; she said, writing out the room-ticket
and handing it to me.</p>

<p>In another moment I was in the lift.</p>

<p>No. 221 was the last door but one at the end
of the eastern corridor of the fourth floor. It
proved to be a double-bedded room, large, exquisitely
ugly, but perfectly appointed in all
matters of comfort; in short, it was characteristic
of the hotel. I knew that every bedroom in that
corridor, and every bedroom in every corridor,
presented exactly the same aspect. One instinctively
felt the impossibility of anything weird,
anything bizarre, anything terrible, entering the
precincts of an abode so solid, cheerful, orderly,
and middle-class. And yet&mdash;but I shall come to
that presently.</p>

<p>It will be well for me to relate all that I did
that evening. I washed, and then took some
valuables out of my bag and put them in my
pocket. Then I glanced round the chamber, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
amongst other satisfactory details noticed that
the electric lights were so fixed that I could read
in bed without distressing my eyes. I then went
downstairs, by the lift, and into the smoke-room.
I had dined on board the express, and so I ordered
nothing but a <i>caf&eacute; noir</i> and a packet of
Virginian cigarettes. After finishing the coffee I
passed into the billiard-room, and played a hundred
up with the marker. To show that my
nerves were at least as steady as usual that night,
I may mention that, although the marker gave
me fifty and beat me, I made a break of twenty
odd which won his generous approval. The
game concluded, I went into the hall and asked
the porter if there were any telegrams for me.
There were not. I noticed that the porter&mdash;it
was the night-porter, and he had just come on
duty&mdash;seemed to have a peculiarly honest and
attractive face. Wishing him good-night, I retired
to bed. It was something after eleven. I read
a chapter of Mr. Walter Crane&#8217;s &#8220;The Bases of
Design,&#8221; and having turned off the light, sank
into the righteous slumber of a man who has
made a pretty break of 20 odd and drunk nothing
but coffee. At three o&#8217;clock I awoke&mdash;not with a
start, but rather gradually. I know it was exactly
three o&#8217;clock because the striking of a notoriously
noisy church clock in the neighbourhood was the
first thing I heard. But the clock had not wakened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
me. I felt sure that something else, something
far more sinister than a church clock, had
been the origin of disturbance.</p>

<p>I listened. Then I heard it again&mdash;It. It
was the sound of a groan in the next room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone indisposed, either in body or
mind,&#8221; I thought lightly, and I tried to go to
sleep again. But I could not sleep. The groans
continued, and grew more poignant, more fearsome.
At last I jumped out of bed and turned
on the light&mdash;I felt easier when I had turned on
the light.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man, whoever he is, is dying.&#8221; The
idea, as it were, sprang at my throat. &#8220;He is
dying. Only a dying man, only a man who saw
Death by his side and trembled before the apparition,
could groan like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>I put on some clothes, and went into the corridor.
The corridor seemed to stretch away into
illimitable distance; and far off, miles off, a solitary
electric light glimmered. My end of the
corridor was a haunt of gloomy shadows, except
where the open door allowed the light from my
bedroom to illuminate the long monotonous pattern
of the carpet. I proceeded to the door next
my own&mdash;the door of No. 222, and put my ear
against the panel. The sound of groans was now
much more distinct and more terrifying. Yes. I
admit that I was frightened. I called. No answer.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; I inquired. No answer.
&#8220;Are you ill, or are you doing this for your own
amusement?&#8221; It was with a sort of bravado
that I threw this last query at the unknown occupant
of the room. No answer. Then I tried to
open the door, but it was fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said to myself; &#8220;either he&#8217;s dying
or he&#8217;s committed a murder and is feeling sorry
for it. I must fetch the night-porter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, hotel lifts are not in the habit of working
at three a.m., and so I was compelled to find
my way along endless corridors and down flights
of stairs apparently innumerable. Here and there
an electric light sought with its yellow eye to
pierce the gloom. At length I reached the hall,
and I well recollect that the tiled floor struck cold
into my slippered but sockless feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a man either dying or very ill in
No. 222,&#8221; I said to the night-porter. He was
reading <i>The Evening News</i>, and appeared to be
very snug in his basket chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so, sir?&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I insisted. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s dying.
Hadn&#8217;t you better do something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come upstairs with you,&#8221; he answered
readily, and without further parley we began the
ascent. At the first floor landing the night-porter
stopped and faced me. He was a man
about forty-five&mdash;every hall-porter seems to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
that age&mdash;and he looked like the father of a
family.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think he&#8217;s dying, sir, I&#8217;ll call up the
manager, Mr. Thom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>The manager slept on the first floor, and he
soon appeared&mdash;a youngish man in a terra-cotta
Jaeger dressing-gown, his eyes full of sleep, yet
alert and anxious to do his duty. I had seen him
previously in the billiard-room. We all three
continued our progress to the fourth floor. Arrived
in front of No. 222 we listened intently,
but we could only hear a faint occasional groan.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s nearly dead,&#8221; I said. The manager
called aloud, but there was no answer. Then he
vainly tried to open the door. The night-porter
departed, and returned with a stout pair of steel
tongs. With these, and the natural ingenuity
peculiar to hotel-porters, he forced open the door,
and we entered No. 222.</p>

<p>A stout, middle-aged man lay on the bed fully
dressed in black. On the floor near the bed was
a silk hat. As we approached the great body
seemed to flutter, and then it lay profoundly and
terribly still. The manager put his hand on the
man&#8217;s head, and held the glass of his watch to
the man&#8217;s parted grey lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is dead,&#8221; said the manager.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; I said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;ve been put to any inconvenience,&#8221;
said the manager, &#8220;and I&#8217;m much obliged
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cold but polite tone was a request to
me to re-enter my own chamber, and leave the
corpse to the manager and the night-porter. I
obeyed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;What about that man?&#8221; I asked the hall-porter
early the next, or rather the same, morning.
I had not slept a wink since three o&#8217;clock,
nor had I heard a sound in the corridor.</p>

<p>&#8220;What man, sir?&#8221; the porter said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; I returned, rather angrily.
&#8220;The man who died in the night&mdash;No. 222.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I assure you, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t the
least notion what you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet his face seemed as honest and open as ever.</p>

<p>I inquired at the office for the manager, and
after some difficulty saw him in his private room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d just see about that man,&#8221; I
began.</p>

<p>&#8220;What man?&#8221; the manager asked, exactly as
the porter had asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; I said, as I was now really
annoyed, &#8220;it&#8217;s all very well giving instructions
to the hall-porter, and I can quite understand
you want the thing kept as quiet as possible. Of
course I know that hotels have a violent objection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
to corpses. But as I saw the corpse, and was of
some assistance to you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said the manager. &#8220;Either you
or I must be completely mad. And,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it is myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say,&#8221; I remarked with
frosty sarcasm, &#8220;that you didn&#8217;t enter Room 222
with me this morning at three a.m. and find a
dead man there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean to say just that,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;&mdash;.&#8221; I got no further. I paid my
bill and left. But before leaving, I went and carefully
examined the door of No. 222. The door
plainly showed marks of some iron instrument.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; I said to the porter as I departed.
&#8220;Accept this half-crown from me. I admire
you.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I had a serious illness extending over three
months. I was frequently delirious, and nearly
every day I saw the scene in Room No. 222. In
the course of my subsequent travels, I once more
found myself, late one night, at the Grand Junction
Terminus Hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Edge,&#8221; said the night-porter, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
looking out for you for weeks and weeks. The
manager&#8217;s compliments, and he would like to see
you in his room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again I saw the youngish, alert manager.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>&#8220;Mr. Edge,&#8221; he began at once, &#8220;it is probable
that I owe you an apology. At any rate, I think
it right to inform you that on the night of the
fifth of November, the year before last, exactly
twelve months before your last visit here, a stout
man died in Room No. 222, at three a.m. I
forgot the circumstance when you last came to
see me in this room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems queer,&#8221; I said coldly, &#8220;that you
should have forgotten such a circumstance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I was not the
manager at that time. My predecessor died two
days after the discovery of the corpse in Room
222.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the night-porter&mdash;is he, too, a new
man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the manager. &#8220;The porter who,
with the late manager, found the corpse in Room
222, is now in Hanwell Lunatic Asylum.&#8221;</p>

<p>I paused, perhaps in awe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you think,&#8221; I said, &#8220;that I was the
victim of a hallucination on my previous visit
here? You think I had a glimpse of the world
of spirits?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On these matters,&#8221; said the manager, &#8220;I
prefer to think nothing.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SATURDAY TO MONDAY.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SO at length I yielded to repeated invitations,
and made up my mind to visit the Vernons
again. And it was in June. I had not been for
nearly two years. The last visit was in the month
of August: I remembered it too well&mdash;that year,
that month, that day!</p>

<p>Under the most favourable circumstances, it
needs enterprise and energy for a Londoner to
pay a week-end visit to a friend&#8217;s house in the
country. No matter how intimate the friend&mdash;and
the Vernons, though charming and full of
good nature, were not really very intimate friends
of mine&mdash;there is always an element of risk in the
affair; I will go further and say an element of
preliminary unpleasantness. It means the disarrangement
of regular habits; it means packing
one&#8217;s bag and lugging it into a hansom; it means
a train-journey; it often means a drive at the
other end; it means sleeping in a strange bed
and finding a suitable hook for one&#8217;s razor strop
the next morning; it means accommodating
oneself to a new social atmosphere, and the expenditure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
of much formal politeness. And suppose
some hitch occurs&mdash;some trifling contretemps
to ruffle the smoothness of the hours&mdash;where
are you then? You are bound to sit tight and
smile till Monday, and at parting to enlarge on
your sorrow that the visit is over, all the while
feeling intensely relieved; and you have got nothing
in exchange for your discomfort and inconvenience
save the satisfaction of duty done&mdash;a
poor return, I venture to add. You know you
have wasted a week-end, an irrecoverable week-end
of eternity.</p>

<p>However, I boarded the train at St. Pancras in
a fairly cheerful mood, and I tried to look on the
bright side of life. The afternoon was certainly
beautiful, and the train not too crowded, and I
derived some pleasure, too, from the contemplation
of a new pair of American boots which I had
recently purchased. I remembered that Mrs.
Vernon used to accuse me of a slight foppishness
in the matter of boots, at the same time wishing
audibly (in his hearing) that Jack would give a
little more attention to the lower portions of his
toilet; Jack was a sportsman, and her husband.
And I thought of their roomy and comfortable
house on the side of the long slope to Bedbury,
and of their orchard and the hammocks under the
trees in the orchard, and of tea and cakes being
brought out to those hammocks, and of the sunsets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
over the Delectable Mountains (we always called
them the Delectable Mountains because they are
the identical hills which Bunyan had in mind
when he wrote &#8220;The Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress&#8221;), and of
Jack&#8217;s easy drawl and Mrs. Vernon&#8217;s chatter, and
the barking of the dogs, and the stamping of the
horses in the stable. And I actually thought:
This will be a pleasant change after London.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do hope they won&#8217;t be awkward and self-conscious,&#8221;
I said to myself. &#8220;And I also must
try not to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>You see I was thinking of that last visit and
what occurred during it. I was engaged to be
married then, to a girl named Lucy Wren. Just
as I had arrived at the Vernons&#8217; house in their
dog-cart the highly rural postman came up in his
cart, and after delivering some letters produced
still another letter and asked if anyone of the name
of Bostock was staying there. I took the letter:
the address was in Lucy&#8217;s handwriting (I had seen
her only on the previous night, and of course she
knew of my visit). I read the letter, standing
there in the garden near the front door, and having
read it I laughed loudly and handed it to Mrs.
Vernon, saying: &#8220;What do you think of that for
a letter?&#8221; In the letter Lucy said that she had
decided to jilt me (she didn&#8217;t use those words&mdash;oh
no!), and that on the following day she was
going to be married to another man. Yes, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
was a cheerful visit I paid to the Vernons, that
August! At first I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing.
They soothed me, calmed me. They did their
best. It wasn&#8217;t their fault after all. They suggested
I should run back to town and see Lucy;
Jack offered to go with me. (Jack!) I declined.
I declined to do anything. I ate hearty meals.
I insisted on our usual excursions. I talked a
lot. I forced them to pretend that nothing had
happened. And on Monday morning I went off
with a cold smile. But it was awful. It stood
between me and the Vernons for a long time, a
terrible memory. And when next Mrs. Vernon
encountered me, in London, there were tears in
her eyes and she was speechless.</p>

<p>Now you will understand better why I said to
myself, with much sincerity: &#8220;I do hope they
won&#8217;t be awkward and self-conscious. And I
also must try not to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the train approached Bedbury I had qualms.
I had qualms about the advisability of this visit
to the Vernons. How could it possibly succeed,
with that memory stalking like a ghost in the garden
near the front door of their delightful and
hospitable house? How could&mdash;&mdash;? Then we
rumbled over the familiar bridge, and I saw the
familiar station yard, and the familiar dog-cart,
and the familiar Dalmatian dog, and the familiar
white mare that was rather young and skittish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
when Lucy jilted me. &#8220;That mare must be rising
seven now,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;and settled down in
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>I descried Mrs. Vernon waiting on the platform
to welcome me, with the twins. Alas! I
had forgotten the twins, those charming and frail
little girls always dressed alike. Invariably, on
my previous visits, I had brought something for
the twins&mdash;a toy, a box of sweets, a couple of bead
necklaces. Never once had I omitted to lay my
tribute on the altar of their adorable infancy.
And now I had forgotten, and my forgetfulness
saddened me, because I knew that it would sadden
them; they would expect, and they would be
disappointed; they would taste the bitterness of
life. &#8220;My poor little dears!&#8221; I thought, as they
smiled and shouted, to see my head out of the
carriage window, &#8220;I feel for you deeply.&#8221;</p>

<p>This beginning was a bad one. Like all men
who have suffered without having deserved to
suffer, I was superstitious, and I felt that the
beginning augured ill. I resigned myself, even
before the train had quite stopped, to a constrained
and bored week-end with the Vernons.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; I exclaimed, with an affectation of
jollity, descending from the carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; responded Mrs. Vernon, with the
same affectation.</p>

<p>It was lamentable, simply lamentable, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
way in which that tragic memory stood between
us and prevented either of us from showing a true,
natural, simple self to the other. Mrs. Vernon
could say little; I could say little; and what we
did say was said stiffly, clumsily. Perhaps it
was fortunate, on the whole, that the twins were
present. They at any rate were natural and self-possessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how old are you now?&#8221; I asked them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are seven,&#8221; they answered politely in
their high, thin voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are like the little girl&#8217;s family in
Wordsworth&#8217;s poem,&#8221; I remarked.</p>

<p>It was astonishing how this really rather good
joke fell flat. Of course the twins did not see it.
But Mrs. Vernon herself did not see it, and I too
thought it, at the moment, inexpressibly feeble.
As for the twins they could not hide their disappointment.
Always before, I had handed them a
little parcel, immediately, either at the station if
they came to meet me, or at the house-door, if
they did not. And to-day I had no little parcel.
I could perceive that they were hoping against
hope, even yet. I could perceive that they were
saying to each other with their large, expressive
eyes: &#8220;Perhaps he has put it in his portmanteau
this time. He can&#8217;t have forgotten us.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could have wept for them. (I was in that
state.) But I could not for the life of me tell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
them outright that I had forgotten the customary
gift, and that I should send it by post on my return.
No, I could not do that. I was too constrained,
too ill at ease. So we all climbed up
into the dog-cart. Mrs. Vernon and I in front,
and the twins behind with the portmanteau to
make weight; and the white mare set off with a
bound, and the Dalmatian barked joyously, and
we all pretended to be as joyous as the dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Jack?&#8221; I inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Mrs. Vernon, as though I had
startled her. &#8220;He had to go to Bedbury Sands
to look at a couple of greyhounds&mdash;it would have
been too late on Monday. I&#8217;m afraid he won&#8217;t
be back for tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>I guessed instantly that, with the average
man&#8217;s cowardice, he had run away in order to
escape meeting me as I entered the house. He
had left that to his wife. No doubt he hoped
that by the time he returned I should have settled
down and the first awkwardness and constraint
would be past.</p>

<p>We said scarcely anything else, Mrs. Vernon
and I, during the three-mile drive. And it was
in silence that we crossed the portal of the
house. Instead of having tea in the orchard we
had it in the drawing-room, the twins being
present. And the tea might have been a funeral
feast.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;I anticipated a certain
mutual diffidence, but nothing so bad as this.
If they couldn&#8217;t be brighter than this, why in
heaven&#8217;s name did they force me to come down?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Vernon was decidedly in a pitiable condition.
She felt for me so much that I felt for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, dears,&#8221; she said to the twins,
after tea was over, and the tea-things cleared away.
And she took the children out of the room. But
before leaving she handed me a note, in silence.
I opened it and read: &#8220;Be as kind to her as you
can; she has suffered a great deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, ere I had time to think, the door, which
Mrs. Vernon had softly closed, was softly opened,
and a woman entered. It was Lucy, once Lucy
Wren. She was as beautiful as ever, and no
older. But her face was the face of one who had
learnt the meaning of life. Till that moment I
had sought everywhere for reasons to condemn
her conduct towards me, to intensify its wickedness.
Now, suddenly, I began to seek everywhere
for reasons to excuse her. She had been so
young, so guileless, so ignorant. I had been too
stern for her. I had frightened her. How could
she be expected to know that the man who had
supplanted me was worthless? She had acted
as she did partly from youthful foolishness and
partly from timidity. She had been in a quandary.
She had lost her head. And so it had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
occurred that one night, that night in August, she
had kissed me falsely, with a lie on her lips, knowing
that her jilting letter was already in the post.
What pangs she must have experienced then!
Yes, as she entered the room and gazed at me
with her blue eyes, my heart overflowed with
genuine sorrow for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucy!&#8221; I murmured, &#8220;you are in mourning!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you know? Has
Mrs. Vernon said nothing? He is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she sank down by the side of my chair
and hid her face, and I could only see her honey-coloured
hair. I stroked it. I knew all her history,
in that supreme moment, without a word of
explanation. I knew that she had been self-deceived,
that she had been through many an agony,
that she had always loved me.... And she was
so young, so young.</p>

<p>I kissed her hair.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;How thankful I am!&#8221; breathed Mrs. Vernon
afterwards. &#8220;Suppose it had not turned out
well!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack Vernon had calculated with some skill.
When he came back, the constraint, the diffidence,
was at an end.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">A DINNER AT THE LOUVRE.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE real name of this renowned West-End
restaurant is not the Louvre. I have christened
it so because the title seems to me to suit
it very nicely, and because a certain disguise is
essential. The proprietors of the Louvre&mdash;it
belongs to an esteemed firm of caterers&mdash;would
decidedly object to the coupling of the name of
their principal establishment with an affair so
curious and disconcerting as that which I am
about to relate. And their objection would be
perfectly justifiable. Nevertheless, the following
story is a true one, and the details of it are
familiar to at least half a dozen persons whose
business it is, for one reason or another, to keep
an eye upon that world of crime and pleasure,
which is bounded on the east by Bow Street and
on the left by Hyde Park Corner.</p>

<p>It was on an evening in the last week of May
that I asked Rosie Mardon to dine with me at the
Louvre. I selected the Louvre, well knowing
that from some mysterious cause all popular
actresses prefer the Louvre to other restaurants,
although the quality of the food there is not always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
impeccable. I am not in the habit of inviting the
favourites of the stage to dinner, especially favourites
who enjoy a salary of seventy-five pounds a
week, as Rosie Mardon did and does. But in the
present case I had a particular object in view.
Rosie Mardon was taking the chief feminine r&ocirc;le
in my new light comedy, then in active rehearsal
at the Alcazar Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue.
We had almost quarrelled over her interpretation
of the big scene in the second act, which differed
materially from my own idea of how the scene
ought to go. Diplomacy was necessary. I prided
myself on my powers as a diplomatist: I knew
that if I could chat with Miss Rosie in the privacy
of a table for two at a public restaurant (there is
no privacy more discreet), I could convert her to
my opinions on that second act.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you engaged a table upstairs?&#8221; was
her first inquiry, as with the assistance of a stout
and gorgeous official I helped her to alight from
her brougham at the portico of the house. (She
looked lovely, and half the street was envying
me; but unfortunately Rosie&#8217;s looks have nothing
to do with the tale; let me therefore dismiss
them as a dangerous topic.)</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I said; &#8220;but I expect there&#8217;ll be plenty
of room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty of room!&#8221; she exclaimed, with a
charming scorn and a glance which said: &#8220;This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
young man really has a great deal to learn about
the art of entertaining ladies at the Louvre.&#8221; I
admit that I had.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; I insisted with bravado.
&#8220;Plenty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask the booking-clerk,&#8221; she commanded,
and with all her inimitable grace she sank like a
fatigued sylph into one of the easy-chairs that
furnished the entrance-hall, and drew her cloak
round her shoulders.</p>

<p>The booking-clerk, in faultless evening-dress,
with a formidable silver chain encircling his neck,
stood at the foot of the grand staircase, which
was very grand. The booking-clerk politely but
coldly informed me that he had not a table upstairs;
he said that every table had been booked
since a quarter to seven.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose we must be content with
downstairs, but I much prefer the balcony,&#8221; said
Rosie when I told her. And Rosie was obviously
cross. My dinner was beginning ominously.</p>

<p>I returned to the booking-clerk, who was then
good enough to tell me that he had no table downstairs
either. I felt rather an ass, but I never
permit my asininity to go too far. I assumed
an attitude of martial decision, and ordered one
of the pages to get me a hansom.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will dine at the Savoy,&#8221; I said, very loud.
Every official in the neighbourhood heard me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
Rosie smiled, whether at the prospect of the Savoy
or at my superb indignation I know not.</p>

<p>Just as we were emerging into the street the
booking-clerk, his silver chain clinking, touched
me on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can let you have a table upstairs now, sir,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;A party that engaged one has not
arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought they wouldn&#8217;t let us run away to
the Savoy,&#8221; I remarked to Rosie <i>sotto voce</i> and
with satisfaction. I had triumphed, and the
pretty creature was a witness of my triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;What name, sir?&#8221; asked the clerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;John Delf,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>His gesture showed that he recognised that
name, and this pleased me too. Had not my
first farcical comedy run a hundred and sixty
nights at the Alcazar? It was only proper that
my reputation should have reached even the clerks
of restaurants. Another official recognised Miss
Rosie&#8217;s much-photographed face, and we passed
up the staircase with considerable &eacute;clat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You managed that rather well,&#8221; said Miss
Rosie, dimpling with satisfaction, as we sat down in
the balcony of the Grand Hall of the Louvre. The
dinner was not beginning so ominously after all.</p>

<p>I narrate these preliminary incidents to show
how large a part is played by pure chance in the
gravest events of our lives.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>I ordered the ten-and-sixpenny dinner. Who
could offer to the unique Rosie Mardon a five-shilling
or a seven-and-sixpenny repast when one
at half-a-guinea was to be obtained? Not I!
The meal started with anchovies, which Rosie
said she adored. (She also adored nougat, <i>cr&ecirc;me
de menthe</i>, and other pagan gods.) As Rosie put
the first bit of anchovy into her adorable mouth,
the Yellow Hungarian Band at the other end of
the crowded hall struck up the Rakocsy March,
and the whole place was filled with clamour.
Why people insist on deafening music as an accompaniment
to the business of eating I cannot
imagine. Personally, I like to eat in peace and
quietude. But I fear I am an exception. Rosie&#8217;s
eyes sparkled with pleasure at the sound of the
band, and I judged the moment opportune to
ascertain her wishes on the subject of wine. She
stated them in her own imperious way, and I
signalled to the waiter.</p>

<p>Now I had precisely noticed, or I fancied I
noticed, an extraordinary obsequiousness in this
waiter&mdash;an obsequiousness surpassing the usual
obsequiousness of waiters. I object to it, and my
attitude of antagonism naturally served to intensify
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with the fellow?&#8221; I said
to Rosie after I had ordered the wine.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very good-looking, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; was her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
only reply, as she gazed absently at the floor
below us crowded with elegant diners.</p>

<p>And the waiter was indeed somewhat handsome.
A light-haired man, and, like all the
waiters at the Louvre, a foreigner with a deficient
knowledge of English.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect he&#8217;s lost on his bets to-day,&#8221; Rosie
added. &#8220;They all bet, you know, and he&#8217;s after
a rousing tip to make up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is that it?&#8221; I said, wondering at the
pretty creature&#8217;s knowledge of the world. And
then I began to talk about my play in my best
diplomatic manner, inwardly chafing at the interruption
of that weird Yellow Hungarian orchestra,
which with bitter irony had hung over the railings
of its stand a placard bearing the words, &#8220;By
desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The meal proceeded brilliantly. My diplomacy
was a success. The champagne was a
success. We arrived at the sorbet, that icy and
sweet product which in these days of enormous
repasts is placed half-way through the meal in
order to renew one&#8217;s appetite for the second half.
Your modern chef is the cruel tyrant of the
stomach, and shows no mercy.</p>

<p>The fair-haired waiter&#8217;s hand distinctly trembled
as he served the sorbets. I looked at mine
for some moments, hesitating whether or not to
venture upon it. I am a martyr to indigestion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s delicious,&#8221; said Rosie. &#8220;More delicious
than the second act of your &#8216;Partners.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I must risk it,&#8221; I replied, and plunged
the spoon into the half-frozen greenish mass. As
I did so I caught sight of our waiter, who was
leaning against the service table at the corner of
the balcony. His face was as white as a sheet.
I thought he must be ill, and I felt sorry for him.
However, I began to swallow the sorbet, and the
sorbet was in truth rather choice. Presently our
waiter clutched at the sleeve of another waiter who
was passing, and whispered a few words in his ear.
The second waiter turned to look at me, and replied.
Then our waiter almost ran towards our table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, sirr,&#8221; he murmured indistinctly,
rolling the &#8220;r.&#8221; &#8220;Are you not Count Vandernoff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not,&#8221; I replied briefly.</p>

<p>He hesitated; his hand wavered towards the
sorbet, but he withdrew it and departed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mon Dieu!&#8221; I heard him exclaim weakly
under his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly he&#8217;s been taking me for an aristocratic
compatriot of his own,&#8221; I said to Rosie,
&#8220;and that explains the obsequiousness. You
were wrong about the betting.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed, but I felt ill at ease, and to cover
my self-consciousness I went on eating the sorbet
very slowly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>I must have consumed nearly a third of it
when I became conscious of a movement behind
me; a mysterious hand shot out and snatched
away the sorbet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir!&#8221; I protested, looking round. A tall,
youngish man in evening dress, but wearing his
hat, stood on my left. &#8220;Sir! what in the name
of&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pardon!&#8221; answered the man in a low
hurried voice. I could not guess his nationality.
&#8220;Let me beg you to leave here at once, and come
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do no such thing,&#8221; I replied.
&#8220;Waiter&mdash;call the manager.&#8221; But our waiter
had disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a matter of life and death,&#8221; said the
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;To whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man removed his hat and looked appealingly
at Miss Rosie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s have a scene in here,&#8221; said Rosie,
with her worldly wisdom. And, impelled by the
utter seriousness of the man, we went out. I
forgot the bill, and no one presented it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I solemnly ask you to take a little drive with
me,&#8221; said the man, when we had reached the
foyer. &#8220;I have a carriage at the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again, why?&#8221; I demanded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>He whispered: &#8220;You are poisoned. I am
saving your life. I rely on your discretion.&#8221;</p>

<p>My spine turned chilly, and I glanced at Miss
Rosie. &#8220;I will come with you,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>In five minutes we had driven to a large house
in Golden Square. We were ushered into a
lavishly-furnished drawing-room, and we sat
down. Rosie&#8217;s lips were set. I admired her
demeanour during those moments.</p>

<p>The man who said he was saving my life
poured some liquid from a phial into a glass, and
handed it to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Emetics are useless. Drink this. In an
hour you will feel the first symptoms of illness.
They may be severe, though that is improbable,
since you ate only a portion of the stuff. In any
event, they will not last. To-morrow you will
be perfectly well. Let me advise you to go to
bed at once. My carriage is at your service and
the service of this lady.&#8221; He bowed.</p>

<p>I drank the antidote.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks for all these surprises,&#8221; I said coldly.
&#8220;But does it not occur to you that some explanation
is due to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He pondered a minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will explain,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;It is your
right. I will explain in two words. You have
heard of Count Vandernoff, attached to the Russian
Embassy in London? You may have seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
in the papers that the Count has been appointed
by the Tsar to be the new governor of Helsingfors,
the Finnish capital?&#8221;</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are aware,&#8221; he continued suavely, &#8220;of
the widespread persecutions in Finland, the taking
away of the Constitution, the Russianising
of all offices, the censorship of the Press? This
persecution has given rise to a secret society, which
I will call the Friends of Finnish Freedom. Its
methods are drastic. Count Vandernoff was
known to be violently antagonistic to Finnish freedom.
He dines often at the Louvre. He had
engaged a table for to-night. The waiter in charge
of that table was, like myself, a member of the
society, but, unfortunately, rather a raw hand.
The Count, quite unexpectedly, did not arrive at
the Louvre to-night. The waiter, however, took
you for the Count. The sorbet which I snatched
out of your hand was&mdash;&mdash; Need I say more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poisoned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poisoned. The affair was carefully arranged,
and only a pure accident could have upset it.
That accident occurred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Count&#8217;s coup&eacute; was knocked over by an
omnibus in Piccadilly two hours ago, and the
Count was killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>&#8220;Then he will never be governor of Helsingfors,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven helps the right!&#8221; the man answered.
&#8220;You English love freedom. You cannot guess
what we in Finland have suffered. Let me repeat
that I rely on your discretion.&#8221;</p>

<p>We left, Miss Rosie and I; and the kind-hearted
girl delivered me safely into the hands of
my housekeeper. I was ill, but I soon recovered.</p>

<p>A few days later I met Miss Rosie at rehearsal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice?&#8221; she said to me, with an
awed air, &#8220;our table was No. 13 that night.&#8221;</p>
